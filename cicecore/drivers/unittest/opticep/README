This unittest tests Icepack optional arguments.  The idea is to have source code that is
identical to the standard CICE source code except the significant optional arguments passed
into Icepack are removed from the CICE calls.  Then to run a standard CICE case with optional
features (fsd, bgc, isotopes, etc) off in namelist.  That results should be bit-for-bit identical
with an equivalent run from the standard source code.

This unittest will need to be maintained manually.  As CICE code changes, the modified files
in the unittest also need to be update manually.  Again, it should be as easy as copying the
standard files into this directory and then commenting out the optional arguments.

NOTES:

All files from cicecore/drivers/standalone/cice need to be copied to this directory.  As of
today, that includes
  CICE.F90
  CICE_FinalMod.F90
  CICE_InitMod.F90
  CICE_RunMod.F90

Add
  write(nu_diag, *) "OPTICEP TEST COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY "
to CICE_FinalMod.F90

Do not worry about the parameter/tracer query/init/write methods

Interfaces to modify include
  ice_init_column.F90  (icepack_step_radiation, icepack_init_zbgc)
  ice_step_mod.F90     (icepack_step_therm1, icepack_step_therm2, icepack_prep_radiation,
                        icepack_step_radiation, icepack_step_ridge)
