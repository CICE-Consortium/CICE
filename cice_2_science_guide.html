<span id="coupl"></span><h2>2.1. Coupling with other climate model components<a class="headerlink" href="#coupling-with-other-climate-model-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The sea ice model exchanges information with the other model components
via a flux coupler. CICE has been coupled into numerous climate models
with a variety of coupling techniques. This document is oriented
primarily toward the CESM Flux Coupler <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kl02" id="id1">[39]</a>
from NCAR, the first major climate model to incorporate CICE. The flux
coupler was originally intended to gather state variables from the
component models, compute fluxes at the model interfaces, and return
these fluxes to the component models for use in the next integration
period, maintaining conservation of momentum, heat, and fresh water.
However, several of these fluxes are now computed in the ice model
itself and provided to the flux coupler for distribution to the other
components, for two reasons. First, some of the fluxes depend strongly
on the state of the ice, and vice versa, implying that an implicit,
simultaneous determination of the ice state and the surface fluxes is
necessary for consistency and stability. Second, given the various ice
types in a single grid cell, it is more efficient for the ice model to
determine the net ice characteristics of the grid cell and provide the
resulting fluxes, rather than passing several values of the state
variables for each cell. These considerations are explained in more
detail below.</p>
<p>The fluxes and state variables passed between the sea ice model and the
CESM flux coupler are listed in&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#tab-flux-cpl"><span class="std std-ref">Table 1</span></a>. By convention,
directional fluxes are positive downward. In CESM, the sea ice model may
exchange coupling fluxes using a different grid than the computational
grid. This functionality is activated using the namelist variable
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gridcpl_file</span></code>. Another namelist variable <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">highfreq</span></code>, allows the
high-frequency coupling procedure implemented in the Regional Arctic
System Model (RASM). In particular, the relative atmosphere-ice velocity
(<span class="math">\(\vec{U}_a-\vec{u}\)</span>) is used instead of the full atmospheric
velocity for computing turbulent fluxes in the atmospheric boundary
layer.</p>

<p>The ice fraction <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> (aice) is the total fractional ice
coverage of a grid cell. That is, in each cell,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\begin{array}{cl}
               a_{i}=0 &amp; \mbox{if there is no ice} \\
               a_{i}=1 &amp; \mbox{if there is no open water} \\
               0&lt;a_{i}&lt;1 &amp; \mbox{if there is both ice and open water,}
\end{array}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(a_{i}\)</span> is the sum of fractional ice areas for each category
of ice. The ice fraction is used by the flux coupler to merge fluxes
from the ice model with fluxes from the other components. For example,
the penetrating shortwave radiation flux, weighted by <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span>, is
combined with the net shortwave radiation flux through ice-free leads,
weighted by (<span class="math">\(1-a_i\)</span>), to obtain the net shortwave flux into the
ocean over the entire grid cell. The flux coupler requires the fluxes to
be divided by the total ice area so that the ice and land models are
treated identically (land also may occupy less than 100% of an
atmospheric grid cell). These fluxes are “per unit ice area&#8221; rather than
“per unit grid cell area.&#8221;</p>
<p>In some coupled climate models (for example, recent versions of the U.K.
Hadley Centre model) the surface air temperature and fluxes are computed
within the atmosphere model and are passed to CICE. In this case the
logical parameter <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">calc_Tsfc</span></code> in <em>ice_therm_vertical</em> is set to false.
The fields <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fsurfn</span></code> (the net surface heat flux from the atmosphere), <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flatn</span></code>
(the surface latent heat flux), and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcondtopn</span></code> (the conductive flux at
the top surface) for each ice thickness category are copied or derived
from the input coupler fluxes and are passed to the thermodynamic driver
subroutine, <em>thermo_vertical</em>. At the end of the time step, the surface
temperature and effective conductivity (i.e., thermal conductivity
divided by thickness) of the top ice/snow layer in each category are
returned to the atmosphere model via the coupler. Since the ice surface
temperature is treated explicitly, the effective conductivity may need
to be limited to ensure stability. As a result, accuracy may be
significantly reduced, especially for thin ice or snow layers. A more
stable and accurate procedure would be to compute the temperature
profiles for both the atmosphere and ice, together with the surface
fluxes, in a single implicit calculation. This was judged impractical,
however, given that the atmosphere and sea ice models generally exist on
different grids and/or processor sets.</p>

<p>The wind velocity, specific humidity, air density and potential
temperature at the given level height <span class="math">\(z_\circ\)</span> are used to
compute transfer coefficients used in formulas for the surface wind
stress and turbulent heat fluxes <span class="math">\(\vec\tau_a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(F_s\)</span>, and
<span class="math">\(F_l\)</span>, as described below. Wind stress is arguably the primary
forcing mechanism for the ice motion, although the ice–ocean stress,
Coriolis force, and slope of the ocean surface are also important
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#szrs97" id="id2">[65]</a>. The sensible and latent heat fluxes,
<span class="math">\(F_s\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F_l\)</span>, along with shortwave and longwave
radiation, <span class="math">\(F_{sw\downarrow}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(F_{L\downarrow}\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(F_{L\uparrow}\)</span>, are included in the flux balance that
determines the ice or snow surface temperature when calc_Tsfc = true.
As described in Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#thermo"><span class="std std-ref">Thermodynamics</span></a>, these fluxes depend nonlinearly
on the ice surface temperature <span class="math">\(T_{sfc}\)</span>. The balance
equation is iterated until convergence, and the resulting fluxes and
<span class="math">\(T_{sfc}\)</span> are then passed to the flux coupler.</p>
<p>The snowfall precipitation rate (provided as liquid water equivalent and
converted by the ice model to snow depth) also contributes to the heat
and water mass budgets of the ice layer. Melt ponds generally form on
the ice surface in the Arctic and refreeze later in the fall, reducing
the total amount of fresh water that reaches the ocean and altering the
heat budget of the ice; this version includes two new melt pond
parameterizations. Rain and all melted snow end up in the ocean.</p>
<p>Wind stress and transfer coefficients for the
turbulent heat fluxes are computed in subroutine
<em>atmo_boundary_layer</em> following <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#kl02" id="id3">[39]</a>. For
clarity, the equations are reproduced here in the present notation.</p>
<p>The wind stress and turbulent heat flux calculation accounts for both
stable and unstable atmosphere–ice boundary layers. Define the

<p>where <span class="math">\(\kappa\)</span> is the von Karman constant, <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is

<p>The wind speed has a minimum value of 1 m/s. We have ignored ice motion

<p>Neglecting form drag,the exchange coefficients <span class="math">\(c_u\)</span>,

<div class="math">
\[\kappa\over \ln(z_{ref}/z_{ice})\]</div>
<p>and updated during a short iteration, as they depend upon the turbulent

<cite>natmiter</cite>. (For the case with form drag, see section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#formdrag"><span class="std std-ref">Variable exchange coefficients</span></a>.)
Here, <span class="math">\(z_{ref}\)</span> is a reference height of 10m and
<span class="math">\(z_{ice}\)</span> is the roughness length scale for the given
sea ice category. <span class="math">\(\Upsilon\)</span> is constrained to have magnitude less
than 10. Further, defining
<span class="math">\(\chi = \left(1-16\Upsilon\right)^{0.25}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\chi \geq 1\)</span>,
the “integrated flux profiles” for momentum and stability in the
unstable (<span class="math">\(\Upsilon &lt;0\)</span>) case are given by</p>
<div class="math">

<p>In a departure from the parameterization used in

<p>The coefficients are then updated as</p>

<p>where <span class="math">\(\lambda = \ln\left(z_\circ/z_{ref}\right)\)</span>. The
first iteration ends with new turbulent scales from

<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#jam99" id="id6">[38]</a>, we have added a constant to the sensible
heat flux coefficient in order to allow some heat to pass between the
atmosphere and the ice surface in stable, calm conditions.</p>
<p>The atmospheric reference temperature <span class="math">\(T_a^{ref}\)</span> is computed from
<span class="math">\(T_a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(T_{sfc}\)</span> using the coefficients
<span class="math">\(c_u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(c_\theta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c_q\)</span>. Although the sea ice
model does not use this quantity, it is convenient for the ice model to
perform this calculation. The atmospheric reference temperature is
returned to the flux coupler as a climate diagnostic. The same is true
for the reference humidity, <span class="math">\(Q_a^{ref}\)</span>.</p>

approximation). For the mushy thermodynamics, <span class="math">\(T_f\)</span> is given by a
piecewise linear liquidus relation. The ocean model calculates the new
ice formation; if the freezing/melting potential
<span class="math">\(F_{frzmlt}\)</span> is positive, its value represents a certain
amount of frazil ice that has formed in one or more layers of the ocean
and floated to the surface. (The ocean model assumes that the amount of
new ice implied by the freezing potential actually forms.)</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(F_{frzmlt}\)</span> is negative, it is used to heat already
existing ice from below. In particular, the sea surface temperature and
salinity are used to compute an oceanic heat flux <span class="math">\(F_w\)</span>
(<span class="math">\(\left|F_w\right| \leq \left|F_{frzmlt}\right|\)</span>) which
is applied at the bottom of the ice. The portion of the melting
potential actually used to melt ice is returned to the coupler in
<span class="math">\(F_{hocn}\)</span>. The ocean model adjusts its own heat budget
with this quantity, assuming that the rest of the flux remained in the
ocean.</p>
<p>In addition to runoff from rain and melted snow, the fresh water flux
<span class="math">\(F_{water}\)</span> includes ice melt water from the top surface
and water frozen (a negative flux) or melted at the bottom surface of
the ice. This flux is computed as the net change of fresh water in the
ice and snow volume over the coupling time step, excluding frazil ice
formation and newly accumulated snow. Setting the namelist option
update_ocn_f to true causes frazil ice to be included in the fresh
water and salt fluxes.</p>
<p>There is a flux of salt into the ocean under melting conditions, and a
(negative) flux when sea water is freezing. However, melting sea ice
ultimately freshens the top ocean layer, since the ocean is much more
saline than the ice. The ice model passes the net flux of salt
<span class="math">\(F_{salt}\)</span> to the flux coupler, based on the net change
in salt for ice in all categories. In the present configuration,
ice_ref_salinity is used for computing the salt flux, although the ice
salinity used in the thermodynamic calculation has differing values in
the ice layers.</p>
<p>A fraction of the incoming shortwave <span class="math">\(F_{sw\Downarrow}\)</span>
penetrates the snow and ice layers and passes into the ocean, as
described in Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#sfc-forcing"><span class="std std-ref">Thermodynamic surface forcing balance</span></a>.</p>
<p>Many ice models compute the sea surface slope <span class="math">\(\nabla H_\circ\)</span>
from geostrophic ocean currents provided by an ocean model or other data
source. In our case, the sea surface height <span class="math">\(H_\circ\)</span> is a
prognostic variable in POP—the flux coupler can provide the surface
slope directly, rather than inferring it from the currents. (The option
of computing it from the currents is provided in subroutine
<em>evp_prep</em>.) The sea ice model uses the surface layer currents
<span class="math">\(\vec{U}_w\)</span> to determine the stress between the ocean and the ice,
and subsequently the ice velocity <span class="math">\(\vec{u}\)</span>. This stress, relative
to the ice,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{aligned}
\vec{\tau}_w&amp;=&amp;c_w\rho_w\left|{\vec{U}_w-\vec{u}}\right|\left[\left(\vec{U}_w-\vec{u}\right)\cos\theta
+\hat{k}\times\left(\vec{U}_w-\vec{u}\right)\sin\theta\right] \end{aligned}\]</div>
<p>is then passed to the flux coupler (relative to the ocean) for use by
the ocean model. Here, <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is the turning angle between
geostrophic and surface currents, <span class="math">\(c_w\)</span> is the ocean drag
coefficient, <span class="math">\(\rho_w\)</span> is the density of seawater, and
<span class="math">\(\hat{k}\)</span> is the vertical unit vector. The turning angle is
necessary if the top ocean model layers are not able to resolve the
Ekman spiral in the boundary layer. If the top layer is sufficiently
thin compared to the typical depth of the Ekman spiral, then
<span class="math">\(\theta=0\)</span> is a good approximation. Here we assume that the top
layer is thin enough.</p>
<p>For CICE run in stand-alone mode (i.e., uncoupled), a thermodynamic slab
ocean mixed-layer parameterization is available in <strong>ice_ocean.F90</strong>.
The turbulent fluxes are computed above the water surface using the same
parameterizations as for sea ice, but with parameters appropriate for
the ocean. The surface flux balance takes into account the turbulent
fluxes, oceanic heat fluxes from below the mixed layer, and shortwave
and longwave radiation, including that passing through the sea ice into
the ocean. If the resulting sea surface temperature falls below the
salinity-dependent freezing point, then new ice (frazil) forms.
Otherwise, heat is made available for melting the ice.</p>

<span id="formdrag"></span><h3>2.1.3. Variable exchange coefficients<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-exchange-coefficients" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the default CICE setup, atmospheric and oceanic neutral drag
coefficients (<span class="math">\(c_u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c_w\)</span>) are assumed constant in time
and space. These constants are chosen to reflect friction associated
with an effective sea ice surface roughness at the ice–atmosphere and
ice–ocean interfaces. Sea ice (in both Arctic and Antarctic) contains
pressure ridges as well as floe and melt pond edges that act as discrete
obstructions to the flow of air or water past the ice, and are a source
of form drag. Following <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#tfsffklb14" id="id11">[71]</a> and based on
recent theoretical developments <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lgha12" id="id12">[46]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#llcl11" id="id13">[45]</a>, the
neutral drag coefficients can now be estimated from properties of the
ice cover such as ice concentration, vertical extent and area of the
ridges, freeboard and floe draft, and size of floes and melt ponds. The
new parameterization allows the drag coefficients to be coupled to the
sea ice state and therefore to evolve spatially and temporally. This
parameterization is contained in the subroutine <em>neutral_drag_coeffs</em>
and is accessed by setting <cite>formdrag</cite> = true in the namelist.</p>
<p>Following <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#tfsffklb14" id="id14">[71]</a>, consider the general case of

can be expressed as</p>

<span class="math">\(c_{q}\)</span>, are initialized to a situation corresponding to neutral
atmosphere–ice and ocean–ice boundary layers. The corresponding neutral

account for form drag, expressed in terms of various contributions as</p>

with <cite>Cdn_atm</cite>, <cite>Cdn_ocn</cite> and the ratio <cite>Cdn_atm_ratio_n</cite> between the
total atmospheric drag and the atmospheric neutral drag coefficient.</p>
<p>We assume that the total neutral drag coefficients are thickness
category independent, but through their dependance on the diagnostic
variables described above, they vary both spatially and temporally. The
total drag coefficients and heat transfer coefficients will also depend
on the type of stratification of the atmosphere and the ocean, and we
use the parameterization described in section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#atmo"><span class="std std-ref">Atmosphere</span></a> that accounts
for both stable and unstable atmosphere–ice boundary layers. In contrast
to the neutral drag coefficients the stability effect of the atmospheric
boundary layer is calculated separately for each ice thickness category.</p>
<p>The transfer coefficient for oceanic heat flux to the bottom of the ice
may be varied based on form drag considerations by setting the namelist
variable <cite>fbot_xfer_type</cite> to <cite>Cdn_ocn</cite>; this is recommended when using
the form drag parameterization. Its default value of the transfer
coefficient is 0.006 (<cite>fbot_xfer_type = ’constant’</cite>).</p>

<h2>2.2. Model components<a class="headerlink" href="#model-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Arctic and Antarctic sea ice packs are mixtures of open water, thin
first-year ice, thicker multiyear ice, and thick pressure ridges. The
thermodynamic and dynamic properties of the ice pack depend on how much
ice lies in each thickness range. Thus the basic problem in sea ice
modeling is to describe the evolution of the ice thickness distribution
(ITD) in time and space.</p>
<p>The fundamental equation solved by CICE is <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#trmc75" id="id23">[69]</a>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-transport-g">
<span class="eqno">(9)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-transport-g" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\frac{\partial g}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot (g {\bf u})

<p>where <span class="math">\({\bf u}\)</span> is the horizontal ice velocity,
<span class="math">\(\nabla = (\frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y})\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(f\)</span> is the rate of thermodynamic ice growth, <span class="math">\(\psi\)</span> is a

fractional area covered by ice in the thickness range <span class="math">\((h,h+dh)\)</span>
at a given time and location.</p>
<p>Equation&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-transport-g">(9)</a> is solved by partitioning the ice pack in
each grid cell into discrete thickness categories. The number of
categories can be set by the user, with a default value <span class="math">\(N_C = 5\)</span>.
(Five categories, plus open water, are generally sufficient to simulate
the annual cycles of ice thickness, ice strength, and surface fluxes
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bhwe01" id="id24">[6]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lipscomb01" id="id25">[42]</a>.) Each category <span class="math">\(n\)</span> has
lower thickness bound <span class="math">\(H_{n-1}\)</span> and upper bound <span class="math">\(H_n\)</span>. The
lower bound of the thinnest ice category, <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span>, is set to zero.
The other boundaries are chosen with greater resolution for small
<span class="math">\(h\)</span>, since the properties of the ice pack are especially sensitive
to the amount of thin ice <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#maykut82" id="id26">[47]</a>. The continuous

open water by <span class="math">\(a_{i0}\)</span>, giving <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=0}^{N_C} a_{in} = 1\)</span>
by definition.</p>
<p>Category boundaries are computed in <em>init_itd</em> using one of several
formulas, summarized in&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#tab-itd"><span class="std std-ref">Table 2</span></a>.
Setting the namelist variable <cite>kcatbound</cite> equal to 0 or 1 gives lower
thickness boundaries for any number of thickness categories <span class="math">\(N_C\)</span>.

these computations are performed in the code itself was chosen so that
quantities sent to the coupler are consistent with each other and as
up-to-date as possible. The Delta-Eddington radiative scheme computes
albedo and shortwave components simultaneously, and in order to have the
most up-to-date values available for the coupler at the end of the
timestep, the order of radiation calculations is shifted. Albedo and
shortwave components are computed after the ice state has been modified
by both thermodynamics and dynamics, so that they are consistent with
the ice area and thickness at the end of the step when sent to the
coupler. However, they are computed using the downwelling shortwave from
the beginning of the timestep. Rather than recompute the albedo and
shortwave components at the beginning of the next timestep using new
values of the downwelling shortwave forcing, the shortwave components
computed at the end of the last timestep are scaled for the new forcing.</p>

<p>(These equations represent quantities within one thickness category;
all melt pond calculations are performed for each category, separately.)
Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-transport-hpnd">(19)</a> expresses conservation of melt pond
volume, but in this form highlights that the quantity tracked in the
code is the pond depth tracer <span class="math">\(h_{pnd}\)</span>, which depends on the pond
area tracer <span class="math">\(a_{pnd}\)</span>. Likewise, <span class="math">\(a_{pnd}\)</span> is a tracer on
ice area (Equation&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-transport-apnd">(18)</a>), which is a state variable, not a
tracer.</p>
<p>For a generic quantity <span class="math">\(q\)</span> that represents a mean value over the
ice fraction, <span class="math">\(q a_i\)</span> is the average value over the grid cell.
Thus for cesm or topo melt ponds, <span class="math">\(h_{pnd}\)</span> can be considered the
actual pond depth, <span class="math">\(h_{pnd}a_{pnd}\)</span> is the mean pond depth over
the sea ice, and <span class="math">\(h_{pnd}a_{pnd}a_i\)</span> is the mean pond depth over
the grid cell. These quantities are illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-tracers"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a>.</p>

illustrates the <em>grid cell</em> fraction of ponds or level ice as defined
by the tracers. The chart on the left provides corresponding ice
thickness and pond depth averages over the grid cell, sea ice and
pond area fractions.</p>
<p>Tracers may need to be modified for physical reasons outside of the
“core&#8221; module or subroutine describing their evolution. For example,
when new ice forms in open water, the new ice does not yet have ponds on
it. Likewise when sea ice deforms, we assume that pond water (and ice)
on the portion of ice that ridges is lost to the ocean.</p>
<p>When new ice is added to a grid cell, the <em>grid cell</em> total area of melt
ponds is preserved within each category gaining ice,
<span class="math">\(a_{pnd}^{t+\Delta t}a_{i}^{t+\Delta t} = a_{pnd}^{t}a_{i}^{t}\)</span>,

<p>Similar calculations are performed for all tracer types, for example
tracer-on-tracer dependencies such as <span class="math">\(h_{pnd}\)</span>, when needed:</p>
<div class="math">
\[h_{pnd}^{t+\Delta t}= {h_{pnd}^{t}a_{pnd}^{t}a_{i}^{t} \over a_{pnd}^{t+\Delta t}a_{i}^{t+\Delta t} }.\]</div>
<p>In this case (adding new ice), <span class="math">\(h_{pnd}\)</span> does not change because
<span class="math">\(a_{pnd}^{t+\Delta t}a_{i}^{t+\Delta t} = a_{pnd}^{t}a_{i}^{t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>When ice is transferred between two thickness categories, we conserve
the total pond area summed over categories <span class="math">\(n\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sum_n a_{pnd}^{t+\Delta t}(n)a_{i}^{t+\Delta t}(n) = \sum_n a_{pnd}^{t}(n)a_{i}^{t}(n).\]</div>
<p>Thus,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:xfer}
a_{pnd}^{t+\Delta t}(m)&amp;=&amp; {\sum_n a_{pnd}^{t}(n)a_{i}^{t}(n) - \sum_{n\ne m} a_{pnd}^{t+\Delta t}(n)a_{i}^{t+\Delta t}(n) \over a_i^{t+\Delta t}(m)  } \\
= {a_{pnd}^t(m)a_i^t(m) + \sum_{n\ne m} \Delta \left(a_{pnd}a_i\right)^{t+\Delta t} \over a_i^{t+\Delta t}(m)  }\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>This is more complicated because of the <span class="math">\(\Delta\)</span> term on the
right-hand side, which is handled manually in <strong>ice_itd.F90</strong>. Such
tracer calculations are scattered throughout the code, wherever there
are changes to the ice thickness distribution.</p>
<p>Note that if a quantity such as <span class="math">\(a_{pnd}\)</span> becomes zero in a grid
cell’s thickness category, then all tracers that depend on it also
become zero. If a tracer should be conserved (e.g., aerosols and the
liquid water in topo ponds), additional code must be added to track
changes in the conserved quantity.</p>

<span id="id44"></span><h4>2.2.1.2. Ice age<a class="headerlink" href="#ice-age" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The age of the ice, <span class="math">\(\tau_{age}\)</span>, is treated as an
ice-volume tracer (<cite>trcr_depend</cite> = 1). It is initialized at 0 when ice
forms as frazil, and the ice ages the length of the timestep during each
timestep. Freezing directly onto the bottom of the ice does not affect
the age, nor does melting. Mechanical redistribution processes and
advection alter the age of ice in any given grid cell in a conservative
manner following changes in ice area. The sea ice age tracer is
validated in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hb09" id="id45">[31]</a>.</p>
<p>Another age-related tracer, the area covered by first-year ice
<span class="math">\(a_{FY}\)</span>, is an area tracer (<cite>trcr_depend</cite> = 0) that corresponds
more closely to satellite-derived ice age data for first-year ice than

September (<cite>yday</cite> = 259) in the northern hemisphere and 15 March (<cite>yday</cite> =

increased when new ice forms in open water, in subroutine

<span id="ice-bgc"></span><h4>2.2.1.3. Sea ice biogeochemistry<a class="headerlink" href="#sea-ice-biogeochemistry" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Ice algal photosynthesis leads to carbon fixation and pigment buildup
throughout much of the pack ice in springtime, including warm layers in
contact with seawater and the central ice matrix. Turbulence moves seed
organisms and trace elements upward across the ocean interface from the
mixed layer <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#aks93" id="id47">[3]</a>, and convection allows them to
penetrate deep into the brine channel network. Gravity drainage is
strongly coupled to carbonate and alkalinity relationships; bio-active
gases including molecular oxygen, dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and methane
exhibit dynamic cycling within and around the ice matrix. All may
ultimately be transferred across the upper interface, into snow cover
and toward the atmosphere. Chlorophyll is often concentrated in thin
layers, capable of absorbing downwelling radiation and redistributing
the implied heat locally.</p>
<p>Although biogeochemical activity occurs throughout the sea ice column,
in the present release we restrict ourselves to simulations of activity
taking place in the lowest few vertical centimeters. A thin intermediate
zone located in this vicinity can be considered distinct because it is
relatively warm, extremely porous and necessarily in close contact with
the seawater nutrient supply. The ecosystems supported are therefore
especially intense, so that they constitute a logical starting point for
code development. The resulting band of biological activity will be
referred to most often in what follows as the ‘bottom zone.’ It
constitutes the dominant habitat for ice algae across most of the
noncoastal Arctic and among land fast ice systems of the Southern
Hemisphere. In the literature and some portions of the code, however,
the alternate term ‘skeletal layer’ is used. For many purposes, the two
are interchangeable. But in fact, the latter is a reference to dendritic
structures more typically observable in the wintertime; ‘bottom zone’ is
the more general term.</p>
<p>Ecological succession in the bottom zone interacts intimately with
chemistry of the upper ocean–atmosphere system. Photosynthesis is
constrained initially by light limitation but soon becomes a matter of
resource availability <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#aks93" id="id48">[3]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#djehmj11" id="id49">[11]</a>. Radiation
intensity dictates the timing of bloom inception. The direct inflow of
salt laden water can then be filtered immediately for the dissolved
nutrient forms, which are converted locally into biomass. In association
with the carbon storage, considerable DMS and molecular oxygen are
generated <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#edhhjjls12" id="id50">[17]</a>. Melt and flush periods cause
bottom ice organisms to be rejected from the matrix mechanically. The
dominant primary producers among them are pennate diatoms, a class
subject to rapid sinking <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ldm05" id="id51">[40]</a>. Hence the amount of
bottom layer biological activity dictates high latitude nutrient and
trace gas levels in the early spring, then carbon drawdown moving into
the period of breakup.</p>
<p>Light transmission passes into the bottom zone through overlying layers
of snow and ice. Attenuation by the ice algae is integrated and averaged
over the bottom three centimeters in which they reside. Our current CICE
release treats inflow of the primary Arctic nutrients nitrate and
silicate, along with the major pathway for nitrogen recycling via
ammonia. Both fertilizers and byproducts are permitted to exchange back
out of the porous bottom volume on a time scale of order hours
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#aks93" id="id52">[3]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ldm05" id="id53">[40]</a>. Biomass multiplies exponentially as
light and nutrient restrictions are lifted, following the rising polar
sun. Uptake accelerates until there is a transition to flux limitation
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#edhhjjls12" id="id54">[17]</a>. At variable times and locations, a
kinetic balance is often reached in which dissolved nitrogen is
sequestered faster than it can leave the porous volume. Computational
terms involved in the ecodynamic simulation resemble Michaelis-Menten
enzyme kinetics, and have been adapted here from a series of pioneering
ice biogeochemistry models
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#aks93" id="id55">[3]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#jdwstwlg06" id="id56">[37]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ldm05" id="id57">[40]</a>. CICE biogeochemical
applications include a series of Pan-Arctic simulations, conceptually
extending from primary production and carbon cycling to the release of
trace gases into the ice domain
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#djehmj11" id="id58">[11]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#edhhjjls12" id="id59">[17]</a>.</p>
<p>The bottom ice biogeochemistry module described here is designed for
ready attachment of extra-nutrient cycling, including byproduct and
detrital processing. Our own mechanism for the generation of DMS is
included in the release as an example. For full details please see
descriptions and schematics in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#edhhjjls12" id="id60">[17]</a>.
Generally speaking, the primary nutrient flow as nitrogen simultaneously
supports formation of silicate frustules by the ice diatoms, along with
carbon biomass production and the implied chlorophyll buildup. Synthesis
of organosulfur metabolites is handled simultaneously and in direct
proportion. DMS spins off of this subsystem at much higher levels than
those familiar from open water studies, since the ice algae are
especially abundant and suffer strong cryological, osmotic and oxidant
stress in an extreme environmental regime <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sstmb07" id="id61">[66]</a>.
The sulfur transformations are governed by a typical pattern of routing
kinetics within and below the ice <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#edhhjjls12" id="id62">[17]</a>, which
reduces the net yield of volatile gas but still permits considerable
buildup and release during the spring thaw.</p>
<p>Biogeochemical processing is modelled as a single layer of reactive
tracers attached to the sea ice bottom. Optional settings are available
via the <em>zbgc_nml</em> namelist in <strong>ice_in</strong>. The prefix <cite>tr_bgc</cite>
signifies a biogeochemical tracer, while the postscript <cite>_sk</cite> indicates
that a particular quantity is restricted to the band of bottom or
skeletal ice material. History fields are controlled in the
<em>icefields_bgc_nml</em> namelist. As with other CICE history fields, the
suffix <cite>_ai</cite> indicates that the field is multiplied by ice area and is
therefore a grid-cell-mean quantity.</p>
<p>Setting the flag <cite>skl_bgc</cite> to true turns on a reduced ‘NP’
(Nitrogen-Plankton) biogeochemistry consisting of nitrate and one algal
tracer. Ammonium (<cite>tr_bgc_Am_sk</cite>), silicate (<cite>tr_bgc_Sil_sk</cite>),
dimethyl sulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in particulate form
(<cite>tr_bgc_DMSPp_sk</cite>), DMSP in dissolved form (<cite>tr_bgc_DMSPd_sk</cite>), and
volatile dimethyl sulfide (<cite>tr_bgc_DMS_sk</cite>) may also be included by
setting the respective flags to true in <strong>ice_in</strong>.</p>
<p>All biogeochemical tracers (<span class="math">\(T_b\)</span>) are brine concentrations
multiplied by the skeletal layer thickness (<span class="math">\(h_{sk}\)</span>). Bulk tracer
concentrations are written to diagnostic files and are found by the
expression <span class="math">\(T_b \phi_{sk}/h_{sk}\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\phi_{sk}\)</span> is the
skeletal layer porosity. Both <span class="math">\(h_{sk}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\phi_{sk}\)</span> are
defined in <strong>ice_zbgc_shared.F90</strong>.</p>
<p>Tracers <span class="math">\(T_b\)</span> are area conserved and follow the horizontal
transport equation&nbsp;([eq:transport_aT]). The initial concentrations of
tracers are specified in subroutine <strong>init_bgc</strong> in <strong>ice_zbgc.F90</strong>.
Silicate and nitrate may be initialized and forced with climatology.
Parameters <cite>sil_data_type</cite> and <cite>nit_data_type</cite> are set in <strong>ice_in</strong>
and take the values ‘clim’ (climatology) and ‘default’ (constant).
<cite>nit_data_type</cite> may also take the value ‘sss’ which sets nitrate to the
ocean salinity value. For climatology, the data directory <cite>bgc_data_dir</cite>
must also be specified. If <cite>restore_bgc</cite> is true, then values are
linearly restored to climatology according to the restoring timescale
<cite>trestore</cite>.</p>
<p>For each horizontal grid point, local biogeochemical tracer equations
are solved in <strong>ice_algae.F90</strong>. There are two types of ice–ocean
tracer flux formulations: ‘Jin2006’ modelled after the growth rate
dependent piston velocity of <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#jdwstwlg06" id="id63">[37]</a>, and
‘constant’ modelled after the constant piston velocity of
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#edhhjjls12" id="id64">[17]</a>. The formulation is specified in
<strong>ice_in</strong> by setting <cite>bgc_flux_type</cite> equal to ‘Jin2006’ or ‘constant’.</p>
<p>In addition to horizontal advection and transport among thickness
categories, biogeochemical tracers (<span class="math">\(T_b\)</span> where
<span class="math">\(b = 1,\ldots, N_b\)</span>) satisfy a set of local coupled equations of
the form</p>

length scale representing the molecular sublayer of the ice–ocean
interface. Its value is absorbed in the piston velocity parameters. The
piston velocity <span class="math">\(w_b\)</span> depends on the particular tracer and the

not the case for ice growth. Unlike dissolved nutrients, algae are able
to cling to the ice matrix and resist expulsion during desalination. For
this reason, algal tracers do not flux between ice and ocean during ice

<span id="aero"></span><h4>2.2.1.4. Aerosols<a class="headerlink" href="#aerosols" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Aerosols may be deposited on the ice and gradually work their way
through it until the ice melts and they are passed into the ocean. They
are defined as ice and snow volume tracers (Equations&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-transport-viT">(16)</a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-transport-vsT">(17)</a>), with the snow and ice each having two tracers for
each aerosol species, one in the surface scattering layer
(delta-Eddington SSL) and one in the snow or ice interior below the SSL.</p>
<p>Rather than updating aerosols for each change to ice/snow thickness due
to evaporation, melting, snow–ice formation, etc., during the
thermodynamics calculation, these changes are deduced from the
diagnostic variables (<cite>melts</cite>, <cite>meltb</cite>, <cite>snoice</cite>, etc) in
<strong>ice_aerosol.F90</strong>. Three processes change the volume of ice or snow
but do not change the total amount of aerosol, thus causing the aerosol
concentration (the value of the tracer itself) to increase: evaporation,
snow deposition and basal ice growth. Basal and lateral melting remove
all aerosols in the melted portion. Surface ice and snow melt leave a
significant fraction of the aerosols behind, but they do “scavenge&#8221; a
fraction of them given by the parameter <cite>kscav</cite> = [0.03, 0.2, 0.02, 0.02,
0.01, 0.01] (only the first 3 are used in CESM, for their 3 aerosol
species). Scavenging also applies to snow–ice formation. When sea ice
ridges, a fraction of the snow on the ridging ice is thrown into the
ocean, and any aerosols in that fraction are also lost to the ocean.</p>
<p>As upper SSL or interior layers disappear from the snow or ice, aerosols
are transferred to the next lower layer, or into the ocean when no ice
remains. The atmospheric flux <cite>faero_atm</cite> contains the rates of aerosol
deposition for each species, while <cite>faero_ocn</cite> has the rate at which the
aerosols are transferred to the ocean.</p>
<p>The aerosol tracer flag <cite>tr_aero</cite> must be set to true in <strong>ice_in</strong>, and
the number of aerosol species is set in <strong>comp_ice</strong>; CESM uses 3.
Results using the aerosol code in the context of CESM are documented in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hbblh12" id="id72">[29]</a>. Global diagnostics are available when
<cite>print_global</cite> is true, and history variables include the mass density
for each layer (snow and ice SSL and interior), and atmospheric and
oceanic fluxes, for each species.</p>

<div class="section" id="brine-height">
<span id="brine-ht"></span><h4>2.2.1.5. Brine height<a class="headerlink" href="#brine-height" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The brine height, <span class="math">\(h_b\)</span>, is the distance from the ice–ocean
interface to the brine surface. When <cite>tr_brine</cite> is set true in
<strong>ice_in</strong> and <cite>TRBRI</cite> is set equal to 1 in <strong>comp_ice</strong>, the brine
surface can move relative to the ice surface. Physically, this occurs
when the ice is permeable and there is a nonzero pressure head: the
difference between the brine height and the equilibrium sea surface.
Brine height motion is computed in <strong>ice_brine.F90</strong> from thermodynamic
variables (<cite>melts</cite>, <cite>meltb</cite>, <cite>meltt</cite>, etc) and the ice microstructural state
deduced from internal bulk salinities and temperature. In the current
release, this tracer is for diagnostic purposes only; it is driven by
the prognostic salinity parameterization but is not used for computing
salinity. In future releases it will be used for transporting
biogeochemical tracers vertically through the ice.</p>
<p>Brine height is transported horizontally as the fraction
<span class="math">\(f_{bri} = h_b/h_i\)</span>, a volume conserved tracer
(Equation&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-transport-viT">(16)</a>). Note that unlike the sea ice porosity, brine
height fraction may be greater than 1 when <span class="math">\(h_b &gt; h_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Vertical transport processes are, generally, a result of the brine
motion. Therefore the vertical transport equations for biogeochemical
tracers will be defined only where brine is present. This region, from
the ice–ocean interface to the brine height, defines the domain of the
vertical bio-grid, whose resolution is independent of the sea ice
vertical grid and is set at compile time (see
Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="cice_3_user_guide.html#bio-grid"><span class="std std-ref">Bio-grid</span></a>). The ice microstructural state,
determined in <strong>ice_brine.F90</strong>, is computed from sea ice salinities
and temperatures linearly interpolated to the bio-grid. When
<span class="math">\(h_b &gt; h_i\)</span>, the upper surface brine is assumed to have the same
microstructural properties as the ice surface.</p>
<p>Changes to <span class="math">\(h_b\)</span> occur from ice and snow melt, ice bottom boundary
changes, and from pressure adjustments. The computation of <span class="math">\(h_b\)</span>
at <span class="math">\(t+\Delta

<p>We wish to solve the continuity or transport equation

<p>There are similar conservation equations for ice volume

<p>By default, ice and snow are assumed to have constant densities, so that
volume conservation is equivalent to mass conservation. Variable-density
ice and snow layers can be transported conservatively by defining
tracers corresponding to ice and snow density, as explained in the
introductory comments in <strong>ice_transport_remap.F90</strong>. Prognostic
equations for ice and/or snow density may be included in future model
versions but have not yet been implemented.</p>
<p>Two transport schemes are available: upwind and the incremental
remapping scheme of <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#db00" id="id73">[12]</a> as modified for sea ice by
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lh04" id="id74">[43]</a>. The remapping scheme has several desirable features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It conserves the quantity being transported (area, volume, or
energy).</li>
<li>It is non-oscillatory; that is, it does not create spurious ripples
in the transported fields.</li>
<li>It preserves tracer monotonicity. That is, it does not create new
extrema in the thickness and enthalpy fields; the values at
time&nbsp;<span class="math">\(m+1\)</span> are bounded by the values at time&nbsp;<span class="math">\(m\)</span>.</li>
<li>It is second-order accurate in space and therefore is much less
diffusive than first-order schemes (e.g., upwind). The accuracy may
be reduced locally to first order to preserve monotonicity.</li>
<li>It is efficient for large numbers of categories or tracers. Much of
the work is geometrical and is performed only once per grid cell
instead of being repeated for each quantity being transported.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time step is limited by the requirement that trajectories projected
backward from grid cell corners are confined to the four surrounding
cells; this is what is meant by incremental remapping as opposed to
general remapping. This requirement leads to a CFL-like condition,</p>
<div class="math">
\[{\max|{\bf u}|\Delta t\over\Delta x}
\leq 1.\]</div>
<p>For highly divergent velocity fields the maximum time step must be
reduced by a factor of two to ensure that trajectories do not cross.
However, ice velocity fields in climate models usually have small
divergences per time step relative to the grid size.</p>
<p>The remapping algorithm can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Given mean values of the ice area and tracer fields in each grid
cell, construct linear approximations of these fields. Limit the
field gradients to preserve monotonicity.</li>
<li>Given ice velocities at grid cell corners, identify departure regions
for the fluxes across each cell edge. Divide these departure regions
into triangles and compute the coordinates of the triangle vertices.</li>
<li>Integrate the area and tracer fields over the departure triangles to
obtain the area, volume, and energy transported across each cell
edge.</li>
<li>Given these transports, update the state variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since all scalar fields are transported by the same velocity field, step
(2) is done only once per time step. The other three steps are repeated
for each field in each thickness category. These steps are described
below.</p>

integrated over a grid cell, the reconstructed fields must have mean
values equal to the known state variables, denoted by <span class="math">\(\bar{a}\)</span>
for fractional area, <span class="math">\(\tilde{h}\)</span> for thickness, and
<span class="math">\(\hat{q}\)</span> for enthalpy. The mean values are not, in general, equal

<p>We preserve monotonicity by van Leer limiting. If

cell and its eight neighbors. Let <span class="math">\(\bar{\phi}_{\max}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\bar{\phi}_{\min}\)</span> be the maximum and minimum values of
<span class="math">\(\bar{\phi}\)</span> over the cell and its neighbors, and let
<span class="math">\(\phi_{\max}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\phi_{\min}\)</span> be the maximum and minimum
values of the reconstructed <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> within the cell. Since the
reconstruction is linear, <span class="math">\(\phi_{\max}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\phi_{\min}\)</span>
are located at cell corners. If <span class="math">\(\phi_{\max} &gt; \bar{\phi}_{\max}\)</span>
or :math:` phi_{min} &lt; bar{phi}_{min}`, we multiply the unlimited
gradient by <span class="math">\(\alpha = \min(\alpha_{\max}, \alpha_{\min})\)</span>, where</p>
<div class="math">
\[\alpha_{\max} =
  (\bar{\phi}_{\max} - \bar{\phi}) / (\phi_{\max} -\bar{\phi}),\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\alpha_{\min} =

<p>Otherwise the gradient need not be limited.</p>
<p>Earlier versions of CICE (through 3.14) computed gradients in physical
space. Starting in version 4.0, gradients are computed in a scaled space
in which each grid cell has sides of unit length. The origin is at the
cell center, and the four vertices are located at (0.5, 0.5),
(-0.5,0.5),(-0.5, -0.5) and (0.5, -0.5). In this coordinate system,
several of the above grid-cell-mean quantities vanish (because they are
odd functions of x and/or y), but they have been retained in the code
for generality.</p>

<span id="loc-dep-triangles"></span><h4>2.2.2.2. Locating departure triangles<a class="headerlink" href="#locating-departure-triangles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The method for locating departure triangles is discussed in detail by
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#db00" id="id78">[12]</a>. The basic idea is illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-deparr"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a>, which shows a shaded quadrilateral departure region
whose contents are transported to the target or home grid cell, labeled
<span class="math">\(H\)</span>. The neighboring grid cells are labeled by compass directions:
<span class="math">\(NW\)</span>, <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, <span class="math">\(NE\)</span>, <span class="math">\(W\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(E\)</span>. The four
vectors point along the velocity field at the cell corners, and the
departure region is formed by joining the starting points of these
vectors. Instead of integrating over the entire departure region, it is
convenient to compute fluxes across cell edges. We identify departure
regions for the north and east edges of each cell, which are also the
south and west edges of neighboring cells. Consider the north edge of
the home cell, across which there are fluxes from the neighboring
<span class="math">\(NW\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N\)</span> cells. The contributing region from the
<span class="math">\(NW\)</span> cell is a triangle with vertices <span class="math">\(abc\)</span>, and that from
the <span class="math">\(N\)</span> cell is a quadrilateral that can be divided into two
triangles with vertices <span class="math">\(acd\)</span> and <span class="math">\(ade\)</span>. Focusing on
triangle <span class="math">\(abc\)</span>, we first determine the coordinates of vertices
<span class="math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(c\)</span> relative to the cell corner (vertex <span class="math">\(a\)</span>),
using Euclidean geometry to find vertex <span class="math">\(c\)</span>. Then we translate the
three vertices to a coordinate system centered in the <span class="math">\(NW\)</span> cell.
This translation is needed in order to integrate fields
(Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#integ-flux"><span class="std std-ref">Integrating fields</span></a>) in the coordinate system where they
have been reconstructed (Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#reconstruct"><span class="std std-ref">Reconstructing area and tracer fields</span></a>). Repeating
this process for the north and east edges of each grid cell, we compute
the vertices of all the departure triangles associated with each cell
edge.</p>

<p>This scheme was originally designed for rectangular grids. Grid cells in
CICE actually lie on the surface of a sphere and must be projected onto
a plane. The projection used in CICE maps each grid cell to a square
with sides of unit length. Departure triangles across a given cell edge
are computed in a coordinate system whose origin lies at the midpoint of
the edge and whose vertices are at (-0.5, 0) and (0.5, 0). Intersection
points are computed assuming Cartesian geometry with cell edges meeting
at right angles. Let CL and CR denote the left and right vertices, which
are joined by line CLR. Similarly, let DL and DR denote the departure
points, which are joined by line DLR. Also, let IL and IR denote the
intersection points (0, <span class="math">\(y_a\)</span>) and (0,:math:<cite>y_b</cite>) respectively,
and let IC = (<span class="math">\(x_c\)</span>, 0) denote the intersection of CLR and DLR. It
can be shown that <span class="math">\(y_a\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y_b\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(x_c\)</span> are given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
 y_a &amp;=&amp; {x_{CL} (y_{DM}-y_{DL}) + x_{DM}y_{DL} - x_{DL}y_{DM}}\over{x_{DM} - x_{DL}}, \\
 y_b &amp;=&amp; {x_{CR} (y_{DR}-y_{DM}) - x_{DM}y_{DR} + x_{DR}y_{DM}}\over{x_{DR} - x_{DM}}, \\
 x_c &amp;=&amp; x_{DL} - y_{DL} \left({x_{DR} - x_{DL}} \over y_{DR} - y_{DL}\right)
 \end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Each departure triangle is defined by three of the seven points (CL,
CR, DL, DR, IL, IR, IC).</p>
<p>Given a 2D velocity field <strong>u</strong>, the divergence
<span class="math">\(\nabla\cdot{\bf u}\)</span> in a given grid cell can be computed from the
local velocities and written in terms of fluxes across each cell edge:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-divergence">
<span class="eqno">(40)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-divergence" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\nabla\cdot{\bf u} = {1\over A}\left[\left({u_{NE}+u_{SE}}\over 2\right)L_E + \left({u_{NW}+u_{SW}}\over 2\right)L_W + \left({u_{NE}+u_{NW}}\over 2\right)L_N + \left({u_{SE}+u_{SW}}\over 2\right)L_S \right],\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(L\)</span> is an edge length and the indices <span class="math">\(N, S, E, W\)</span>
denote compass directions. Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-divergence">(40)</a> is equivalent to
the divergence computed in the EVP dynamics (Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#dynam"><span class="std std-ref">Dynamics</span></a>).
In general, the fluxes in this expression are not equal to those implied
by the above scheme for locating departure regions. For some
applications it may be desirable to prescribe the divergence by
prescribing the area of the departure region for each edge. This can be
done in CICE 4.0 by setting <cite>l_fixed_area</cite> = true in
<strong>ice_transport_driver.F90</strong> and passing the prescribed departure
areas (<cite>edgearea_e</cite> and <cite>edgearea_n</cite>) into the remapping routine. An extra
triangle is then constructed for each departure region to ensure that
the total area is equal to the prescribed value. This idea was suggested
and first implemented by Mats Bentsen of the Nansen Environmental and
Remote Sensing Center (Norway), who applied an earlier version of the
CICE remapping scheme to an ocean model. The implementation in CICE 4.0
is somewhat more general, allowing for departure regions lying on both
sides of a cell edge. The extra triangle is constrained to lie in one
but not both of the grid cells that share the edge. Since this option
has yet to be fully tested in CICE, the current default is
<cite>l_fixed_area</cite> = false.</p>
<p>We made one other change in the scheme of <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#db00" id="id80">[12]</a> for
locating triangles. In their paper, departure points are defined by
projecting cell corner velocities directly backward. That is,</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-departure_points">

<p>where <span class="math">\(\mathbf{x}_D\)</span> is the location of the departure point
relative to the cell corner and <span class="math">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> is the velocity at
the corner. This approximation is only first-order accurate. Accuracy
can be improved by estimating the velocity at the midpoint of the
trajectory.</p>

<p>There are now different rheologies available in the CICE code. The
elastic-viscous-plastic (EVP) model represents a modification of the
standard viscous-plastic (VP) model for sea ice dynamics
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hibler79" id="id83">[26]</a>. The elastic-anisotropic-plastic (EAP) model,
on the other hand, explicitly accounts for the observed sub-continuum
anisotropy of the sea ice cover <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#wf06" id="id84">[78]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ws09" id="id85">[76]</a>. If
<cite>kdyn</cite>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 in the namelist then the EVP rheology is used (module
<strong>ice_dyn_evp.F90</strong>), while <cite>kdyn</cite>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 is associated with the EAP
rheology (<strong>ice_dyn_eap.F90</strong>). At times scales associated with the
wind forcing, the EVP model reduces to the VP model while the EAP model
reduces to the anisotropic rheology described in detail in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#wf06" id="id86">[78]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#tfw13" id="id87">[72]</a>. At shorter time scales the
adjustment process takes place in both models by a numerically more
efficient elastic wave mechanism. While retaining the essential physics,
this elastic wave modification leads to a fully explicit numerical
scheme which greatly improves the model’s computational efficiency.</p>
<p>The EVP sea ice dynamics model is thoroughly documented in

respectively in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hz99" id="id93">[36]</a> and

shaped floes (see <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-eap"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 5</span></a>). In contrast to the isotropic EVP

depends on the relative orientation of the diamond shaped floes (unit
vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf r\)</span> in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-eap"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 5</span></a>), with respect to the
principal direction of the deformation rate (not shown). Local
anisotropy of the sea ice cover is accounted for by an additional

compressive, failure occurs through axial splitting along the
compression direction; (iii) under biaxial compression with a low
confinement ratio, (<span class="math">\(\sigma_{1}/\sigma_{2}&lt;R\)</span>), sea ice fails
Coulombically through formation of slip lines delineating new ice

solved within the EVP subcycling loop, and consistently with the
momentum and stress evolution equations, we neglect the advection term
for the structure tensor. Equation&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-evolutionA">(56)</a> then reduces to the system
of two equations:</p>
<div class="math">

\[\sigma_1^{k+1}\left(1+\alpha_1\right) = \alpha_1\sigma_1^k + {P\over\Delta} \left(\dot{\epsilon} - \Delta\right).\]</div>
<p>This is equivalent to Eq.&nbsp;(23) in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bflm13" id="id115">[8]</a>, but
using <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> at the current subcycle <span class="math">\(k+1\)</span> in the last

<div class="math">
\[\alpha_2 = {2T\over e^2\Delta t_e} = {\alpha_1\over e^2}\]</div>
<p>produces equations equivalent to Eq.&nbsp;(23) in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bflm13" id="id116">[8]</a> for <span class="math">\(\sigma_2\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\sigma_{12}\)</span>. Therefore the only change needed in the stress
code is to use <span class="math">\(\alpha_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\alpha_2\)</span> instead of
<span class="math">\(2T / \Delta t_e\)</span> and <span class="math">\(2T /e^2 \Delta t_e\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bflm13" id="id117">[8]</a> introduce another change to the EVP
stress equations by altering the form of Young’s modulus in the elastic
term: the coefficient of <span class="math">\(\partial\sigma_1/\partial t\)</span> is
<span class="math">\(1/E\)</span>, but it is <span class="math">\(e^2/E\)</span> in the <span class="math">\(\sigma_2\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\sigma_{12}\)</span> equations. This change does not affect the VP
equations to which the EVP equations should converge, but it does affect
the transient path taken during the subcycling. Since EVP subcycling is
finite, the numerical solutions obtained using this method differ from
the original EVP code.</p>
<p>To implement this second change, we need define only
<span class="math">\(\alpha_1 = {2T/\Delta t_e}\)</span> as above and incorporate the factor
of <span class="math">\(e^2\)</span> from <span class="math">\(\alpha_2\)</span> into the equations for
<span class="math">\(\sigma_2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sigma_{12}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\sigma_1^{k+1}\left(1+\alpha_1\right) &amp;=&amp;\sigma_1^k +  {\alpha_1}{P\over\Delta} D_D, \\

<p>To minimize code changes and unify the two approaches, we define and
apply <span class="math">\(1/\alpha_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> in the classic EVP code, and
modify the elastic stress term. These under-relaxation parameters
control the rate at which the iteration converges. Thus for classic EVP
we set</p>

<p>The stress equations for <cite>stressp</cite> (<span class="math">\(\sigma_1\)</span>) are unchanged; the

revised EVP and 0 for classic EVP. Revised EVP is activated by setting
the namelist parameter <cite>revised_evp</cite> = true. Note that in the current
implementation, only the modified version of the elastic term is
available for either the classic (<cite>revised_evp</cite> = false) or the revised
EVP method. A final difference is that the revised approach initializes
the stresses to 0 at the beginning of each time step, while the classic
EVP approach uses the previous time step value.</p>

<p>which is obtained from Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-transport-g">(9)</a> by neglecting the first and
third terms on the right-hand side. We use the remapping method of
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lipscomb01" id="id118">[42]</a>, in which thickness categories are
represented as Lagrangian grid cells whose boundaries are projected
forward in time. The thickness distribution function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> is
approximated as a linear function of <span class="math">\(h\)</span> in each displaced
category and is then remapped onto the original thickness categories.
This method is numerically smooth and is not too diffusive. It can be
viewed as a 1D simplification of the 2D incremental remapping scheme
described above.</p>
<p>We first compute the displacement of category boundaries in thickness
space. Assume that at time <span class="math">\(m\)</span> the ice areas <span class="math">\(a_n^m\)</span> and
mean ice thicknesses <span class="math">\(h_n^m\)</span> are known for each thickness
category. (For now we omit the subscript <span class="math">\(i\)</span> that distinguishes
ice from snow.) We use a thermodynamic model (Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#thermo"><span class="std std-ref">Thermodynamics</span></a>)
to compute the new mean thicknesses <span class="math">\(h_n^{m+1}\)</span> at time
<span class="math">\(m+1\)</span>. The time step must be small enough that trajectories do not
cross; i.e., <span class="math">\(h_n^{m+1} &lt; h_{n+1}^{m+1}\)</span> for each pair of adjacent
categories. The growth rate at <span class="math">\(h = h_n\)</span> is given by
<span class="math">\(f_n = (h_n^{m+1} - h_n^m) / \Delta t\)</span>. By linear interpolation we
estimate the growth rate <span class="math">\(F_n\)</span> at the upper category boundary
<span class="math">\(H_n\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[F_n = f_n + \frac{f_{n+1}-f_n}{h_{n+1}-h_n} \, (H_n - h_n).\]</div>
<p>If <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span> or <span class="math">\(a_{n+1} = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(F_n\)</span> is set to the growth
rate in the nonzero category, and if <span class="math">\(a_n = a_{n+1} = 0\)</span>, we set
<span class="math">\(F_n = 0\)</span>. The temporary displaced boundaries are given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[H_n^* = H_n + F_n \, \Delta t, \ n = 1 \ {\rm to} \ N-1\]</div>
<p>The boundaries must not be displaced by more than one category to the
left or right; that is, we require <span class="math">\(H_{n-1} &lt; H_n^* &lt; H_{n+1}\)</span>.
Without this requirement we would need to do a general remapping rather
than an incremental remapping, at the cost of added complexity.</p>
<p>Next we construct <span class="math">\(g(h)\)</span> in the displaced thickness categories.
The ice areas in the displaced categories are <span class="math">\(a_n^{m+1} = a_n^m\)</span>,
since area is conserved following the motion in thickness space (i.e.,
during vertical ice growth or melting). The new ice volumes are
<span class="math">\(v_n^{m+1} = (a_n h_n)^{m+1} = a_n^m h_n^{m+1}\)</span>. For conciseness,
define <span class="math">\(H_L = H_{n-1}^*\)</span> and <span class="math">\(H_R = H_{n}^*\)</span> and drop the
time index <span class="math">\(m+1\)</span>. We wish to construct a continuous function
<span class="math">\(g(h)\)</span> within each category such that the total area and volume at
time <span class="math">\(m+1\)</span> are <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v_n\)</span>, respectively:</p>

<p>If <span class="math">\(H_n^* &lt; H_N\)</span>, ice area and volume are transferred from

<span class="math">\(v_n\)</span> between the original boundaries <span class="math">\(H_{n-1}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(H_n\)</span> in each category. The new thicknesses,
<span class="math">\(h_n = v_n/a_n\)</span>, are guaranteed to lie in the range
<span class="math">\((H_{n-1}, H_n)\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(g = 0\)</span> in the part of a category that

<p>Other conserved quantities are transferred in proportion to the ice
volume <span class="math">\(\Delta v_{in}\)</span>. For example, the transferred ice energy in

<span class="math">\(\Delta e_{ink} = e_{ink} (\Delta v_{in} / v_{in})\)</span>.</p>
<p>The left and right boundaries of the domain require special treatment.
If ice is growing in open water at a rate <span class="math">\(F_0\)</span>, the left boundary
<span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> is shifted to the right by <span class="math">\(F_0 \Delta t\)</span> before
<span class="math">\(g\)</span> is constructed in category 1, then reset to zero after the
remapping is complete. New ice is then added to the grid cell,
conserving area, volume, and energy. If ice cannot grow in open water
(because the ocean is too warm or the net surface energy flux is
downward), <span class="math">\(H_0\)</span> is fixed at zero, and the growth rate at the left
boundary is estimated as <span class="math">\(F_0 = f_1\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(F_0 &lt; 0\)</span>, all ice
thinner than <span class="math">\(\Delta h_0 = -F_0 \Delta t\)</span> is assumed to have
melted, and the ice area in category 1 is reduced accordingly. The area
of new open water is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\Delta a_0 = \int_{0}^{\Delta h_0} g \, dh.\]</div>
<p>The right boundary <span class="math">\(H_N\)</span> is not fixed but varies with
<span class="math">\(h_N\)</span>, the mean ice thickness in the thickest category. Given
<span class="math">\(h_N\)</span>, we set <span class="math">\(H_N = 3 h_N - 2 H_{N-1}\)</span>, which ensures that
<span class="math">\(g(h) &gt; 0\)</span> for <span class="math">\(H_{N-1} &lt; h &lt; H_N\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g(h) = 0\)</span> for
<span class="math">\(h \geq H_N\)</span>. No ice crosses the right boundary. If the ice growth
or melt rates in a given grid cell are too large, the thickness
remapping scheme will not work. Instead, the thickness categories in
that grid cell are treated as delta functions following
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bhwe01" id="id119">[6]</a>, and categories outside their prescribed
boundaries are merged with neighboring categories as needed. For time
steps of less than a day and category thickness ranges of 10 cm or more,
this simplification is needed rarely, if ever.</p>
<p>The linear remapping algorithm for thickness is not monotonic for
tracers, although significant errors rarely occur. Usually they appear
as snow temperatures (enthalpy) outside the physical range of values in
very small snow volumes. In this case we transfer the snow and its heat
and tracer contents to the ocean.</p>

<span id="mech-red"></span><h4>2.2.4.2. Mechanical redistribution<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanical-redistribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The last term on the right-hand side of Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-transport-g">(9)</a>
is <span class="math">\(\psi\)</span>, which describes the redistribution
of ice in thickness space due to ridging and other mechanical processes.
The mechanical redistribution scheme in CICE is based on
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#trmc75" id="id120">[69]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#rothrock75" id="id121">[57]</a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hibler80" id="id122">[27]</a>, <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#fh95" id="id123">[19]</a>, and
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lhmj07" id="id124">[44]</a>. This scheme converts thinner ice to thicker
ice and is applied after horizontal transport. When the ice is
converging, enough ice ridges to ensure that the ice area does not
exceed the grid cell area.</p>
<p>First we specify the participation function: the thickness distribution
<span class="math">\(a_P(h) = b(h) \, g(h)\)</span> of the ice participating in ridging. (We
use “ridging” as shorthand for all forms of mechanical redistribution,
including rafting.) The weighting function <span class="math">\(b(h)\)</span> favors ridging
of thin ice and closing of open water in preference to ridging of
thicker ice. There are two options for the form of <span class="math">\(b(h)\)</span>. If
<cite>krdg_partic</cite> = 0 in the namelist, we follow <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#trmc75" id="id125">[69]</a>
and set</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-partic-old-contin">

<p>where <span class="math">\(G(h)\)</span> is the fractional area covered by ice thinner than

<span class="math">\(a_P(h)\)</span> between category boundaries <span class="math">\(H_{n-1}\)</span> and

<p>where <span class="math">\(a_{Pn}\)</span> is the ratio of the ice area ridging (or open
water area closing) in category <span class="math">\(n\)</span> to the total area ridging and
closing, and <span class="math">\(G_n\)</span> is the total fractional ice area in categories

Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-partic-old-discrete">(76)</a> is valid with <span class="math">\(G^*\)</span> replacing
<span class="math">\(G_n\)</span>, and if <span class="math">\(G_{n-1} &gt; G^*\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(a_{Pn} = 0\)</span>. If
the open water fraction <span class="math">\(a_0 &gt; G^*\)</span>, no ice can ridge, because
“ridging” simply reduces the area of open water. As in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#trmc75" id="id126">[69]</a> we set <span class="math">\(G^* = 0.15\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the spatial resolution is too fine for a given time step
<span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>, the weighting function Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-partic-old-contin">(75)</a> can
promote numerical instability. For <span class="math">\(\Delta t = \mbox{1 hour}\)</span>,
resolutions finer than <span class="math">\(\Delta x \sim \mbox{10 km}\)</span> are typically
unstable. The instability results from feedback between the ridging
scheme and the dynamics via the ice strength. If the strength changes
significantly on time scales less than <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>, the
viscous-plastic solution of the momentum equation is inaccurate and
sometimes oscillatory. As a result, the fields of ice area, thickness,
velocity, strength, divergence, and shear can become noisy and
unphysical.</p>
<p>A more stable weighting function was suggested by

<p>This weighting function is used if <cite>krdg_partic</cite> = 1 in the namelist.
From Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-partic-new-contin">(77)</a>, the mean value of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> for ice
participating in ridging is <span class="math">\(a^*\)</span>, as compared to <span class="math">\(G^*/3\)</span>
for Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-partic-old-contin">(75)</a>. For typical ice thickness distributions,
setting <span class="math">\(a^* = 0.05\)</span> with <cite>krdg_partic</cite> = 1 gives participation
fractions similar to those given by <span class="math">\(G^* = 0.15\)</span> with <cite>krdg_partic</cite>
= 0. See <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#lhmj07" id="id128">[44]</a> for a detailed comparison of these
two participation functions.</p>
<p>Thin ice is converted to thick, ridged ice in a way that reduces the
total ice area while conserving ice volume and internal energy. There
are two namelist options for redistributing ice among thickness
categories. If <cite>krdg_redist</cite> = 0, ridging ice of thickness <span class="math">\(h_n\)</span>
forms ridges whose area is distributed uniformly between
<span class="math">\(H_{\min} = 2 h_n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(H_{\max} = 2 \sqrt{H^* h_n}\)</span>, as in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hibler80" id="id129">[27]</a>. The default value of <span class="math">\(H^*\)</span> is 25&nbsp;m, as
in earlier versions of CICE. Observations suggest that
<span class="math">\(H^* = 50\)</span>&nbsp;m gives a better fit to first-year ridges
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ami04" id="id130">[1]</a>, although the lower value may be appropriate
for multiyear ridges <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#fh95" id="id131">[19]</a>. The ratio of the mean
ridge thickness to the thickness of ridging ice is
<span class="math">\(k_n = (H_{\min} + H_{\max}) / (2 h_n)\)</span>. If the area of category
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> is reduced by ridging at the rate <span class="math">\(r_n\)</span>, the area of
thicker categories grows simultaneously at the rate <span class="math">\(r_n/k_n\)</span>.
Thus the <em>net</em> rate of area loss due to ridging of ice in category
<span class="math">\(n\)</span> is <span class="math">\(r_n(1-1/k_n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The ridged ice area and volume are apportioned among categories in the
thickness range <span class="math">\((H_{\min}, H_{\max})\)</span>. The fraction of the new
ridge area in category <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is</p>

<p>This uniform redistribution function tends to produce too little ice in

<p>Given <span class="math">\(R_{\mathrm{net}}\)</span> from&nbsp;Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-Rnet">(84)</a>, we
use&nbsp;Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-Rtot-Rnet">(85)</a> to compute <span class="math">\(R_{\mathrm{tot}}\)</span>. Then the area
ridged in category <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is given by <span class="math">\(a_{rn} = r_n \Delta t\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(r_n = a_{Pn} R_{\mathrm{tot}}\)</span>. The area of new ridges is
<span class="math">\(a_{rn} / k_n\)</span>, and the volume of new ridges is <span class="math">\(a_{rn} h_n\)</span>
(since volume is conserved during ridging). We remove the ridging ice
from category <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and use Equations&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ridge-area-old">(79)</a>
and&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ridge-volume-old">(80)</a>: (or <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ridge-area-new">(82)</a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ridge-volume-new">(83)</a>) to redistribute the ice among thicker
categories.</p>
<p>Occasionally the ridging rate in thickness category <span class="math">\(n\)</span> may be
large enough to ridge the entire area <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span> during a time interval
less than <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>. In this case <span class="math">\(R_{\mathrm{tot}}\)</span> is
reduced to the value that exactly ridges an area <span class="math">\(a_n\)</span> during
<span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>. After each ridging iteration, the total fractional ice
area <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> is computed. If <span class="math">\(a_i &gt; 1\)</span>, the ridging is
repeated with a value of <span class="math">\(R_{\mathrm{net}}\)</span> sufficient to yield
<span class="math">\(a_i = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Two tracers for tracking the ridged ice area and volume are available.
The actual tracers are for level (undeformed) ice area (<cite>alvl</cite>) and volume
(<cite>vlvl</cite>), which are easier to implement for a couple of reasons: (1) ice
ridged in a given thickness category is spread out among the rest of the
categories, making it more difficult (and expensive) to track than the
level ice remaining behind in the original category; (2) previously
ridged ice may ridge again, so that simply adding a volume of freshly
ridged ice to the volume of previously ridged ice in a grid cell may be
inappropriate. Although the code currently only tracks level ice
internally, both level ice and ridged ice are offered as history output.
They are simply related:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
a_{lvl} + a_{rdg} &amp;=&amp; a_i, \\
v_{lvl} + v_{rdg} &amp;=&amp; v_i.\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Level ice area fraction and volume increase with new ice formation and
decrease steadily via ridging processes. Without the formation of new
ice, level ice asymptotes to zero because we assume that both level ice
and ridged ice ridge, in proportion to their fractional areas in a grid
cell (in the spirit of the ridging calculation itself which does not
prefer level ice over previously ridged ice).</p>
<p>The ice strength <span class="math">\(P\)</span> may be computed in either of two ways. If the
namelist parameter kstrength = 0, we use the strength formula from
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hibler79" id="id136">[26]</a>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-hib-strength">
<span class="eqno">(86)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-hib-strength" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[P = P^* h \exp[-C(1-a_i)],\]</div>

empirical constants, and <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is the mean ice thickness.
Alternatively, setting kstrength = 1 gives an ice strength closely
related to the ridging scheme. Following
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#rothrock75" id="id137">[57]</a>, the strength is assumed proportional
to the change in ice potential energy <span class="math">\(\Delta E_P\)</span> per unit area

of <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is included because <span class="math">\(a_{Pn}\)</span> is normalized with
respect to the total area of ice ridging, not the net area removed.
Recall that more than one unit area of ice must be ridged to reduce the
net ice area by one unit. For exponential ridge ITDs (<cite>krdg_redist</cite> = 1),
the ridge potential energy is modified:</p>

<span id="thermo"></span><h4>2.2.4.3. Thermodynamics<a class="headerlink" href="#thermodynamics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The current CICE version includes three thermodynamics
options, the “zero-layer&#8221; thermodynamics of <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#semtner76" id="id140">[60]</a>
(<cite>ktherm</cite> = 0), the Bitz and Lipscomb model <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bl99" id="id141">[7]</a>
(<cite>ktherm</cite> = 1) that assumes a fixed salinity profile, and a new “mushy&#8221;
formulation (<cite>ktherm</cite> = 2) in which salinity evolves
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#thb13" id="id142">[73]</a>. For each thickness category, CICE computes
changes in the ice and snow thickness and vertical temperature profile
resulting from radiative, turbulent, and conductive heat fluxes. The ice
has a temperature-dependent specific heam to simulate the effect of
brine pocket melting and freezing, for <cite>ktherm</cite> = 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Each thickness category <span class="math">\(n\)</span> in each grid cell is treated as a
horizontally uniform column with ice thickness
<span class="math">\(h_{in} = v_{in}/a_{in}\)</span> and snow thickness
<span class="math">\(h_{sn} = v_{sn}/a_{in}\)</span>. (Henceforth we omit the category
index&nbsp;<span class="math">\(n\)</span>.) Each column is divided into <span class="math">\(N_i\)</span> ice layers
of thickness <span class="math">\(\Delta h_i = h_i/N_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N_s\)</span> snow layers of
thickness <span class="math">\(\Delta h_s = h_s/N_s\)</span>. The surface temperature (i.e.,
the temperature of ice or snow at the interface with the atmosphere) is
<span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>, which cannot exceed . The temperature at the
midpoint of the snow layer is <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span>, and the midpoint ice layer
temperatures are <span class="math">\(T_{ik}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> ranges from 1 to
<span class="math">\(N_i\)</span>. The temperature at the bottom of the ice is held at
<span class="math">\(T_f\)</span>, the freezing temperature of the ocean mixed layer. All
temperatures are in degrees Celsius unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>Each ice layer has an enthalpy <span class="math">\(q_{ik}\)</span>, defined as the negative
of the energy required to melt a unit volume of ice and raise its
temperature to . Because of internal melting and freezing in brine
pockets, the ice enthalpy depends on the brine pocket volume and is a
function of temperature and salinity. We can also define a snow enthalpy
<span class="math">\(q_s\)</span>, which depends on temperature alone.</p>
<p>Given surface forcing at the atmosphere–ice and ice–ocean interfaces
along with the ice and snow thicknesses and temperatures/enthalpies at
time&nbsp;<span class="math">\(m\)</span>, the thermodynamic model advances these quantities to
time&nbsp;<span class="math">\(m+1\)</span> (ktherm=2 also advances salinity). The calculation
proceeds in two steps. First we solve a set of equations for the new
temperatures, as discussed in Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#thermo-temp"><span class="std std-ref">New temperatures</span></a>. Then we
compute the melting, if any, of ice or snow at the top surface, and the
growth or melting of ice at the bottom surface, as described in
Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#thermo-growth"><span class="std std-ref">Growth and melting</span></a>. We begin by describing the surface
forcing parameterizations, which are closely related to the ice and snow
surface temperatures.</p>

<span id="ponds"></span><h5>2.2.4.3.1. Melt ponds<a class="headerlink" href="#melt-ponds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Three explicit melt pond parameterizations are available in CICE, and
all must use the delta-Eddington radiation scheme, described below. The
default (ccsm3) shortwave parameterization incorporates melt ponds
implicitly by adjusting the albedo based on surface conditions.</p>
<p>For each of the three explicit parameterizations, a volume
<span class="math">\(\Delta V_{melt}\)</span> of melt water produced on a given category may
be added to the melt pond liquid volume:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\Delta V_{melt} = {r\over\rho_w} \left({\rho_{i}}\Delta h_{i} + {\rho_{s}}\Delta h_{s} + F_{rain}{\Delta t}\right) a_i,\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math">
\[r = r_{min} + \left(r_{max} - r_{min}\right) a_i\]</div>
<p>is the fraction of the total melt water available that is added to the
ponds, <span class="math">\(\rho_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\rho_s\)</span> are ice and snow densities,
<span class="math">\(\Delta h_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Delta h_s\)</span> are the thicknesses of ice and
snow that melted, and <span class="math">\(F_{rain}\)</span> is the rainfall rate. Namelist
parameters are set for the level-ice (<cite>tr_pond_lvl</cite>) parameterization;
in the cesm and topo pond schemes the standard values of <span class="math">\(r_{max}\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(r_{min}\)</span> are 0.7 and 0.15, respectively.</p>
<p>Radiatively, the surface of an ice category is divided into fractions of
snow, pond and bare ice. In these melt pond schemes, the actual pond
area and depth are maintained throughout the simulation according to the
physical processes acting on it. However, snow on the sea ice and pond
ice may shield the pond and ice below from solar radiation. These
processes do not alter the actual pond volume; instead they are used to
define an “effective pond fraction&#8221; (and likewise, effective pond depth,
snow fraction and snow depth) used only for the shortwave radiation
calculation.</p>
<p>In addition to the physical processes discussed below, tracer equations
and definitions for melt ponds are also described in
Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#tracers"><span class="std std-ref">Tracers</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-tracers"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>CESM formulation</strong> (<cite>tr_pond_cesm</cite> = true)</p>
<p>Melt pond area and thickness tracers are carried on each ice thickness
category as in Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#tracers"><span class="std std-ref">Tracers</span></a>. Defined simply as the product
of pond area, <span class="math">\(a_p\)</span>, and depth, <span class="math">\(h_p\)</span>, the melt pond volume,
<span class="math">\(V_{p}\)</span>, grows through addition of ice or snow melt water or rain
water, and shrinks when the ice surface temperature becomes cold,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
{\rm pond \ growth:\ } \ V_{p}^\prime &amp;=&amp; V_{p}(t) +\Delta V_{melt} , \\
{\rm pond \ contraction:\ } \ V_{p}(t+\Delta t) &amp;=&amp; V_{p}^\prime\exp\left[r_2\left( {\max\left(T_p-T_{sfc}, 0\right) \over T_p}\right)\right], \end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(dh_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(dh_{s}\)</span> represent ice and snow melt at
the top surface of each thickness category and <span class="math">\(r_2=0.01\)</span>. Here,
<span class="math">\(T_p\)</span> is a reference temperature equal to -2 <span class="math">\(^\circ\)</span>C.
Pond depth is assumed to be a linear function of the pond fraction
(<span class="math">\(h_p=\delta_p a_p\)</span>) and is limited by the category ice thickness
(<span class="math">\(h_p \le 0.9 h_i\)</span>). The pond shape (<cite>pndaspect</cite>)
<span class="math">\(\delta_p = 0.8\)</span> in the standard CESM pond configuration. The area
and thickness are computed according to the assumed pond shape, and the
pond area is then reduced in the presence of snow for the radiation
calculation. Ponds are allowed only on ice at least 1&nbsp;cm thick. This
formulation differs slightly from that documented in
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hbblh12" id="id143">[29]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Topographic formulation</strong> (<cite>tr_pond_topo</cite> = true)</p>
<p>The principle concept of this scheme is that melt water runs downhill
under the influence of gravity and collects on sea ice with increasing
surface height starting at the lowest height
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#ff07" id="id144">[20]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#fft10" id="id145">[21]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#fsfh12" id="id146">[22]</a>. Thus, the topography of the
ice cover plays a crucial role in determining the melt pond cover.
However, CICE does not explicitly represent the topography of sea ice.
Therefore, we split the existing ice thickness distribution function
into a surface height and basal depth distribution assuming that each
sea ice thickness category is in hydrostatic equilibrium at the
beginning of the melt season. We then calculate the position of sea
level assuming that the ice in the whole grid cell is rigid and in
hydrostatic equilibrium.</p>

basal depth distribution fractions. The height of the steps is the
height of the ice above the reference level, and the width of the steps
is the area of ice of that height. The illustration does not imply a
particular assumed topography, rather it is assumed that all thickness
categories are present at the sub-grid scale so that water will always
flow to the lowest surface height class.</p>
<p>Once a volume of water is produced from ice and snow melting, we
calculate the number of ice categories covered by water. At each time

<p>As the melting season progresses, not only does melt water accumulate
upon the upper surface of the sea ice, but the sea ice beneath the melt
water becomes more porous owing to a reduction in solid fraction
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#egprf04" id="id147">[16]</a>. The hydraulic head of melt water on sea
ice (i.e., its height above sea level) drives flushing of melt water
through the porous sea ice and into the underlying ocean. The mushy

ice lid can grow, partially melt, or melt completely. Provided that the
ice lid is thinner than a critical lid depth (1 cm is suggested) then
the pond is regarded as effective, i.e. the pond affects the optical
properties of the ice cover. Effective pond area and pond depth for each
thickness category are passed to the radiation scheme for calculating
albedo. Note that once the ice lid has exceeded the critical thickness,
snow may accumulate on the lid causing a substantial increase in albedo.
In the current CICE model, melt ponds only affect the thermodynamics of
the ice through the albedo. To conserve energy, the ice lid is dismissed
once the pond is completely refrozen.</p>
<p>As the sea ice area shrinks due to melting and ridging, the pond volume
over the lost area is released to the ocean immediately. In
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#fft10" id="id151">[21]</a>, the pond volume was carried as an ice area
tracer, but in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#fsfh12" id="id152">[22]</a> and here, pond area and
thickness are carried as separate tracers, as in
Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#tracers"><span class="std std-ref">Tracers</span></a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the cesm and level-ice melt pond schemes, the liquid pond water
in the topo parameterization is not necessarily virtual; it can be
withheld from being passed to the ocean model until the ponds drain by
setting the namelist variable <cite>l_mpond_fresh</cite> = .true. The refrozen pond
lids are still virtual. Extra code needed to track and enforce
conservation of water has been added to <strong>ice_itd.F90</strong> (subroutine
<em>zap_small_areas</em>), <strong>ice_mechred.F90</strong> (subroutine <em>ridge_shift</em>),
<strong>ice_therm_itd.F90</strong> (subroutines <em>linear_itd</em> and <em>lateral_melt</em>),
and <strong>ice_therm_vertical.F90</strong> (subroutine <em>thermo_vertical</em>), along
with global diagnostics in <strong>ice_diagnostics.F90</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Level-ice formulation</strong> (<cite>tr_pond_lvl</cite> = true)</p>
<p>This meltpond parameterization represents a combination of ideas from
the empirical CESM melt pond scheme and the topo approach, and is
documented in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hhl13" id="id153">[35]</a>. The ponds evolve according to
physically based process descriptions, assuming a thickness-area ratio
for changes in pond volume. A novel aspect of the new scheme is that the
ponds are carried as tracers on the level (undeformed) ice area of each
thickness category, thus limiting their spatial extent based on the
simulated sea ice topography. This limiting is meant to approximate the
horizontal drainage of melt water into depressions in ice floes. (The
primary difference between the level-ice and topo meltpond
parameterizations lies in how sea ice topography is taken into account
when determining the areal coverage of ponds.) Infiltration of the snow
by melt water postpones the appearance of ponds and the subsequent
acceleration of melting through albedo feedback, while snow on top of
refrozen pond ice also reduces the ponds’ effect on the radiation
budget.</p>
<p>Melt pond processes, described in more detail below, include addition of
liquid water from rain, melting snow and melting surface ice, drainage
of pond water when its weight pushes the ice surface below sea level or
when the ice interior becomes permeable, and refreezing of the pond
water. If snow falls after a layer of ice has formed on the ponds, the
snow may block sunlight from reaching the ponds below. When melt water
forms with snow still on the ice, the water is assumed to infiltrate the
snow. If there is enough water to fill the air spaces within the
snowpack, then the pond becomes visible above the snow, thus decreasing
the albedo and ultimately causing the snow to melt faster. The albedo
also decreases as snow depth decreases, and thus a thin layer of snow
remaining above a pond-saturated layer of snow will have a lower albedo
than if the melt water were not present.</p>
<p>The level-ice formulation assumes a thickness-area ratio for <em>changes</em>
in pond volume, while the CESM scheme assumes this ratio for the total
pond volume. Pond volume changes are distributed as changes to the area
and to the depth of the ponds using an assumed aspect ratio, or shape,
given by the parameter <span class="math">\(\delta_p\)</span> (<cite>pndaspect</cite>),
<span class="math">\(\delta_p = {\Delta h_p / \Delta a_{p}}\)</span> and

<p>B. The <cite>frzpnd</cite> = ‘cesm’ option uses the same empirical function as in the
CESM melt pond parameterization.</p>
<p><em>Radiative effects.</em> Freshwater ice that has formed on top of a melt
pond is assumed to be perfectly clear. Snow may accumulate on top of the
pond ice, however, shading the pond and ice below. The depth of the snow
on the pond ice is initialized as <span class="math">\(h_{ps}^0 = F_{snow}\Delta t\)</span> at
the first snowfall after the pond ice forms. From that time until either
the pond ice or the pond snow disappears, the pond snow depth tracks the
depth of snow on sea ice (<span class="math">\(h_s\)</span>) using a constant difference
<span class="math">\(\Delta\)</span>. As <span class="math">\(h_s\)</span> melts, <span class="math">\(h_{ps}=h_s-\Delta\)</span> will be
reduced to zero eventually, at which time the pond ice is fully
uncovered and shortwave radiation passes through.</p>
<p>To prevent a sudden change in the shortwave reaching the sea ice (which
can prevent the thermodynamics from converging), thin layers of snow on
pond ice are assumed to be patchy, thus allowing the shortwave flux to
increase gradually as the layer thins. This is done using the same
parameterization for patchy snow as is used elsewhere in CICE, but with
its own parameter <span class="math">\(h_{s1}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[a_{pnd}^{eff} = \left(1 - \min\left(h_{ps}/h_{s1}, 1\right)\right) a_{pnd} a_{lvl}.\]</div>
<p>If any of the pond ice melts, the radiative flux allowed to pass through
the ice is reduced by the (roughly) equivalent flux required to melt
that ice. This is accomplished (approximately) with
<span class="math">\(a_{pnd}^{eff} = (1-f_{frac})a_{pnd}a_{lvl}\)</span>, where (see
Equation&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ipndmelt">(108)</a>)</p>
<div class="math">
\[f_{frac} = \min\left(-{\rho_i L\Delta h_i\over F_\circ \Delta t}, 1 \right) .\]</div>
<p><em>Snow infiltration by pond water.</em> If there is snow on top of the sea
ice, melt water may infiltrate the snow. It is a “virtual process” that
affects the model’s thermodynamics through the input parameters of the
radiation scheme; it does not melt the snow or affect the snow heat
content.</p>
<p>A snow pack is considered saturated when its percentage of liquid water
content is greater or equal to 15% (Sturm and others, 2009). We assume
that if the volume fraction of retained melt water to total liquid
content</p>
<div class="math">
\[r_p = {V_p\over V_p + V_s \rho_s / \rho_0} &lt; 0.15,\]</div>
<p>then effectively there are no meltponds present, that is,
<span class="math">\(a_{pnd}^{eff}=h_{pnd}^{eff}=0\)</span>. Otherwise, we
assume that the snowpack is saturated with liquid water.</p>
<p>We assume that all of the liquid water accumulates at the base of the
snow pack and would eventually melt the surrounding snow. Two
configurations are therefore possible, (1) the top of the liquid lies
below the snow surface and (2) the liquid water volume overtops the
snow, and all of the snow is assumed to have melted into the pond. The
volume of void space within the snow that can be filled with liquid melt
water is</p>
<div class="math">
\[V_{mx}=h_{mx}a_{p} = {\left(\rho_0-\rho_s\over \rho_0\right)}h_s a_{p},\]</div>
<p>and we compare <span class="math">\(V_p\)</span> with <span class="math">\(V_{mx}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Case 1: For <span class="math">\(V_p &lt; V_{mx}\)</span>, we define <span class="math">\(V_p^{eff}\)</span> to
be the volume of void space filled by the volume <span class="math">\(V_p\)</span> of melt
water: <span class="math">\(\rho_0 V_p =  (\rho_0-\rho_s) V_p^{eff},\)</span> or in
terms of depths,</p>
<div class="math">
\[h_p^{eff} = {\left(\rho_0  \over \rho_0 - \rho_s\right)}h_{pnd}.\]</div>
<p>The liquid water under the snow layer is not visible and therefore the
ponds themselves have no direct impact on the radiation
(<span class="math">\(a_{pnd}^{eff}=h_{pnd}^{eff}=0\)</span>), but the
effective snow thickness used for the radiation scheme is reduced to</p>
<div class="math">
\[h_s^{eff} = h_s - h_p^{eff}a_p = h_s - {\rho_0 \over \rho_0 - \rho_s}h_{pnd} a_p.\]</div>
<p>Here, the factor <span class="math">\(a_p=a_{pnd}a_{lvl}\)</span> averages the reduced snow
depth over the ponds with the full snow depth over the remainder of the
ice; that is, <span class="math">\(h_s^{eff} = h_s(1-a_p) + (h_s -h_p^{eff})a_p.\)</span></p>
<p>Case 2: Similarly, for <span class="math">\(V_p \ge V_{mx}\)</span>, the total mass in the
liquid is <span class="math">\(\rho_0 V_p + \rho_s V_s = \rho_0 V_p^{eff},\)</span> or</p>
<div class="math">
\[h_p^{eff} = {\rho_0 h_{pnd} + \rho_s h_{s} \over \rho_0}.\]</div>
<p>Thus the effective depth of the pond is the depth of the whole slush
layer <span class="math">\(h_p^{eff}\)</span>. In this case,
<span class="math">\(a_{pnd}^{eff}=a_{pnd}a_{lvl}\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Drainage.</em> A portion <span class="math">\(1-r\)</span> of the available melt water drains
immediately into the ocean. Once the volume changes described above have
been applied and the resulting pond area and depth calculated, the pond
depth may be further reduced if the top surface of the ice would be
below sea level or if the sea ice becomes permeable.</p>
<p>We require that the sea ice surface remain at or above sea level. If the
weight of the pond water would push the mean ice–snow interface of a
thickness category below sea level, some or all of the pond water is
removed to bring the interface back to sea level via Archimedes’
Principle written in terms of the draft <span class="math">\(d\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\rho_i h_i + \rho_s h_s + \rho_0 h_p = \rho_w d \le \rho_w h_i.\]</div>
<p>There is a separate freeboard calculation in the thermodynamics which
considers only the ice and snow and converts flooded snow to sea ice.
Because the current melt ponds are “virtual&#8221; in the sense that they only
have a radiative influence, we do not allow the pond mass to change the
sea ice and snow masses at this time, although this issue may need to be
reconsidered in the future, especially for the Antarctic.</p>
<p>The mushy thermodynamics scheme (<cite>ktherm</cite>&nbsp;<span class="math">\(= 2\)</span>) handles flushing.
For <cite>ktherm</cite>&nbsp;<span class="math">\(\ne 2\)</span>, the permeability of the sea ice is calculated
using the internal ice temperatures <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span> (computed from the
enthalpies as in the sea ice thermodynamics). The brine salinity and
liquid fraction are given by <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#notz05" id="id154">[52]</a> [eq 3.6]
<span class="math">\(S_{br} = {1/ (10^{-3} - 0.054/T_i)}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\phi = S/S_{br}\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(S\)</span> is the bulk salinity of the combined ice and brine. The
ice is considered permeable if <span class="math">\(\phi \ge 0.05\)</span> with a permeability
of <span class="math">\(p=3\times 10^{-8}\min(\phi^3)\)</span> (the minimum being taken over
all of the ice layers). A hydraulic pressure head is computed as
<span class="math">\(P=g\rho_w\Delta h\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\Delta h\)</span> is the height of the
pond and sea ice above sea level. Then the volume of water drained is
given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\Delta V_{perm} = -a_{pnd} \min\left(h_{pnd}, {p P d_p \Delta t \over \mu h_i}\right),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(d_p\)</span> is a scaling factor (dpscale), and
<span class="math">\(\mu=1.79\times 10^{-3}\)</span>&nbsp;kg&nbsp;m <span class="math">\(^{-1}\)</span>&nbsp;s <span class="math">\(^{-1}\)</span> is the
dynamic viscosity.</p>
<p><em>Conservation elsewhere.</em> When ice ridges and when new ice forms in open
water, the level ice area changes and ponds must be handled
appropriately. For example, when sea ice deforms, some of the level ice
is transformed into ridged ice. We assume that pond water (and ice) on
the portion of level ice that ridges is lost to the ocean. All of the
tracer volumes are altered at this point in the code, even though
<span class="math">\(h_{pnd}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h_{ipnd}\)</span> should not change; compensating
factors in the tracer volumes cancel out (subroutine <em>ridge_shift</em> in
<strong>ice_mechred.F90</strong>).</p>
<p>When new ice forms in open water, level ice is added to the existing sea
ice, but the new level ice does not yet have ponds on top of it.
Therefore the fractional coverage of ponds on level ice decreases
(thicknesses are unchanged). This is accomplished in
<strong>ice_therm_itd.F90</strong> (subroutine <em>add_new_ice</em>) by maintaining the

<p>The net surface energy flux from the atmosphere to the ice (with all
fluxes defined as positive downward) is</p>
<div class="math">
\[F_0 = F_s + F_l + F_{L\downarrow} + F_{L\uparrow} +
         (1-\alpha) (1-i_0) F_{sw},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(F_s\)</span> is the sensible heat flux, <span class="math">\(F_l\)</span> is the latent
heat flux, <span class="math">\(F_{L\downarrow}\)</span> is the incoming longwave flux,
<span class="math">\(F_{L\uparrow}\)</span> is the outgoing longwave flux, <span class="math">\(F_{sw}\)</span> is
the incoming shortwave flux, <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> is the shortwave albedo, and
<span class="math">\(i_0\)</span> is the fraction of absorbed shortwave flux that penetrates
into the ice. The albedo may be altered by the presence of melt ponds.
Each of the explicit melt pond parameterizations (CESM, topo and
level-ice ponds) should be used in conjunction with the Delta-Eddington
shortwave scheme, described below.</p>
<p><em>Shortwave radiation: Delta-Eddington</em></p>
<p>Two methods for computing albedo and shortwave fluxes are available, the
default (“ccsm3&#8221;) method, described below, and a multiple scattering
radiative transfer scheme that uses a Delta-Eddington approach.
“Inherent&#8221; optical properties (IOPs) for snow and sea ice, such as
extinction coefficient and single scattering albedo, are prescribed
based on physical measurements; reflected, absorbed and transmitted
shortwave radiation (“apparent&#8221; optical properties) are then computed
for each snow and ice layer in a self-consistent manner. Absorptive
effects of inclusions in the ice/snow matrix such as dust and algae can
also be included, along with radiative treatment of melt ponds and other
changes in physical properties, for example granularization associated
with snow aging. The Delta-Eddington formulation is described in detail
in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bl07" id="id155">[9]</a>. Since publication of this technical paper,
a number of improvements have been made to the Delta-Eddington scheme,
including a surface scattering layer and internal shortwave absorption
for snow, generalization for multiple snow layers and more than four
layers of ice, and updated IOP values.</p>
<p>The namelist parameters <cite>R_ice</cite> and <cite>R_pnd</cite> adjust the albedo of bare or
ponded ice by the product of the namelist value and one standard
deviation. For example, if <cite>R_ice</cite> = 0.1, the albedo increases by
<span class="math">\(0.1\sigma\)</span>. Similarly, setting <cite>R_snw</cite> = 0.1 decreases the snow
grain radius by <span class="math">\(0.1\sigma\)</span> (thus increasing the albedo). Two
additional tuning parameters are available for this scheme, <cite>dT_mlt</cite> and
<cite>rsnw_mlt</cite>. <cite>dT_mlt</cite> is the temperature change needed for a change in snow
grain radius from non-melting to melting, and <cite>rsnw_mlt</cite> is the maximum
snow grain radius when melting. An absorption coefficient for algae
(<cite>kalg</cite>) may also be set. See <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bl07" id="id156">[9]</a> for details; the
CESM melt pond and Delta-Eddington parameterizations are further
explained and validated in <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#hbblh12" id="id157">[29]</a>.</p>
<p><em>Shortwave radiation: CCSM3</em></p>
<p>In the parameterization used in the previous version of the Community
Climate System Model (CCSM3), the albedo depends on the temperature and
thickness of ice and snow and on the spectral distribution of the
incoming solar radiation. Albedo parameters have been chosen to fit
observations from the SHEBA field experiment. For
<span class="math">\(T_{sf} &lt; -1^{circ}C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h_i &gt; ` `ahmax\)</span>, the bare ice
albedo is 0.78 for visible wavelengths (<span class="math">\(&lt;700\)</span>nm) and 0.36 for
near IR wavelengths (<span class="math">\(&gt;700\)</span>nm). As <span class="math">\(h_i\)</span> decreases from
ahmax to zero, the ice albedo decreases smoothly (using an arctangent
function) to the ocean albedo, 0.06. The ice albedo in both spectral
bands decreases by 0.075 as <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> rises from
<span class="math">\(-1^{circ}C\)</span> to . The albedo of cold snow (<span class="math">\(T_{sf} &lt;
-1^{circ}C\)</span>) is 0.98 for visible wavelengths and 0.70 for near IR
wavelengths. The visible snow albedo decreases by 0.10 and the near IR
albedo by 0.15 as <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> increases from <span class="math">\(-1^{circ}C\)</span>
to . The total albedo is an area-weighted average of the ice and snow
albedos, where the fractional snow-covered area is</p>
<div class="math">
\[f_{snow} = \frac{h_s}{h_s + h_{snowpatch}},\]</div>
<p>and <span class="math">\(h_{snowpatch} = 0.02 \ {\mathrm m}\)</span>. The envelope
of albedo values is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-albedo"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 7</span></a>. This albedo
formulation incorporates the effects of melt ponds implicitly; the
explicit melt pond parameterization is not used in this case.</p>

<p><em>Longwave radiation, turbulent fluxes</em></p>
<p>While incoming shortwave and longwave radiation are obtained from the

are derived quantities. Outgoing longwave takes the standard blackbody

remaining <span class="math">\(\left(1-\epsilon\right)F_{L\downarrow}\)</span> being returned
to the atmosphere via <span class="math">\(F_{L\uparrow}\)</span>.) The sensible heat flux is

<p><strong>Zero-layer thermodynamics</strong> (<cite>ktherm</cite> = 0)
An option for zero-layer thermodynamics <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#semtner76" id="id162">[60]</a> is
available in this version of CICE by setting the namelist parameter
ktherm to 0 and changing the number of ice layers, nilyr, in
<strong>ice_domain_size.F90</strong> to 1. In the zero-layer case, the ice is
fresh and the thermodynamic calculations are much simpler than in the
other configurations, which we describe here.</p>
<p><strong>Bitz and Lipscomb thermodynamics</strong> (<cite>ktherm</cite> = 1)</p>
<p>The “BL99&#8221; thermodynamic sea ice model is based on

salinity profile is prescribed and is unchanging in time. The snow is
assumed to be fresh, and the midpoint salinity <span class="math">\(S_{ik}\)</span> in each

<p>where <span class="math">\(z \equiv (k-1/2)/N_i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(S_{\max} = 3.2\)</span> ppt, and
<span class="math">\(a=0.407\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b=0.573\)</span> are determined from a
least-squares fit to the salinity profile observed in multiyear sea
ice by <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#schwarzacher59" id="id166">[59]</a>. This profile varies from
<span class="math">\(S=0\)</span> at the top surface (<span class="math">\(z = 0\)</span>) to <span class="math">\(S=S_{\max}\)</span>
at the bottom surface (<span class="math">\(z=1\)</span>) and is similar to that used by
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#mu71" id="id167">[50]</a>. Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-salinity">(111)</a> is fairly accurate
for ice that has drained at the top surface due to summer melting. It
is not a good approximation for cold first-year ice, which has a more
vertically uniform salinity because it has not yet drained. However,
the effects of salinity on heat capacity are small for temperatures
well below freezing, so the salinity error does not lead to
significant temperature errors.</p>
<p><em>Temperature updates.</em></p>

<span class="math">\(T_s^m\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(T_{ik}^m\)</span> at time&nbsp;<span class="math">\(m\)</span>, we solve a set
of finite-difference equations to obtain the new temperatures at
time&nbsp;<span class="math">\(m+1\)</span>. Each temperature is coupled to the temperatures of
the layers immediately above and below by heat conduction terms that are
treated implicitly. For example, the rate of change of <span class="math">\(T_{ik}\)</span>
depends on the new temperatures in layers <span class="math">\(k-1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, and
<span class="math">\(k+1\)</span>. Thus we have a set of equations of the form</p>

(3)&nbsp;<span class="math">\(T_{sf} &lt; 0^{circ}C\)</span>, snow absent; and
(4)&nbsp;<span class="math">\(T_{sf} = 0^{circ}C\)</span>, snow absent. For case 1 we have
one equation (the top row of the matrix) for the new surface
temperature, <span class="math">\(N_s\)</span> equations for the new snow temperatures, and
<span class="math">\(N_i\)</span> equations for the new ice temperatures. For cases 2 and 4 we
omit the equation for the surface temperature, which is held at , and
for cases 3 and 4 we omit the snow temperature equations. Snow is
considered absent if the snow depth is less than a user-specified

solar radiation is equal to zero for snow-covered ice, since most of the
incoming sunlight is absorbed near the top surface. If shortwave =
‘dEdd’, however, then <span class="math">\(I_{pen}\)</span> is nonzero in snow layers.</p>
<p>It is possible that more shortwave penetrates into an ice layer than is
needed to completely melt the layer, or else it causes the computed
temperature to be greater than the melting temperature, which until now
has caused the vertical thermodynamics code to abort. A parameter
<cite>frac</cite> = 0.9 sets the fraction of the ice layer than can be melted through.
A minimum temperature difference for absorption of radiation is also
set, currently <cite>dTemp</cite> = 0.02 (K). The limiting occurs in
<strong>ice_therm_vertical.F90</strong>, for both the default and delta Eddington
radiation schemes. If the available energy would melt through a layer,
then penetrating shortwave is first reduced, possibly to zero, and if
that is insufficient then the local conductivity is also reduced to
bring the layer temperature just to the melting point.</p>
<p>We now convert Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ice-temp-change">(113)</a> to finite-difference form. The

at material boundaries, and first-order accurate in time. Before writing
the equations in full we give finite-difference expressions for some of
the terms.</p>
<p>First consider the terms on the left-hand side of
Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ice-temp-change">(113)</a>. We write the time derivatives as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =

<p>where <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is the temperature of either ice or snow and <span class="math">\(m\)</span>

<p>which ensures that energy is conserved during a change in temperature.
This can be shown by using Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity">(114)</a> to integrate
<span class="math">\(c_i \, dT\)</span> from <span class="math">\(T_{ik}^m\)</span> to <span class="math">\(T_{ik}^{m+1}\)</span>; the

is given by Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity-fd">(117)</a>. The specific heat is a nonlinear
function of <span class="math">\(T_{ik}^{m+1}\)</span>, the unknown new temperature. We can
retain a set of linear equations, however, by initially guessing
<span class="math">\(T_{ik}^{m+1} = T_{ik}^m\)</span> and then iterating the solution,

<p>where <span class="math">\(\eta_k = \Delta t/(\rho_k c_k \Delta h_k)\)</span>. In the
equation for the bottom ice layer, the temperature at the ice–ocean
interface is held fixed at <span class="math">\(T_f\)</span>, the freezing temperature of the
mixed layer; thus the last term on the LHS is known and is moved to the
RHS. If <span class="math">\(T_{sf} = 0^{circ}C\)</span> , then there is no surface flux
equation. In this case the first equation in Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-tridiag">(112)</a> is similar
to Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-tridiag-form">(122)</a>, but with the first term on the LHS moved to the
RHS.</p>
<p>These equations are modified if <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(F_{ct}\)</span> are computed within the atmospheric model and
passed to CICE (calc_Tsfc = false; see Section <a class="reference internal" href="#atmo"><span class="std std-ref">Atmosphere</span></a>). In this case there
is no surface flux equation. The top layer temperature is computed by an
equation similar to Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-tridiag-form">(122)</a> but with the first term on the
LHS replaced by <span class="math">\(\eta_1 F_{ct}\)</span> and moved to the RHS. The
main drawback of treating the surface temperature and fluxes explicitly
is that the solution scheme is no longer unconditionally stable.
Instead, the effective conductivity in the top layer must satisfy a
diffusive CFL condition:</p>
<div class="math">
\[K^* \le {\rho ch \over \Delta t}.\]</div>
<p>For thin layers and typical coupling intervals (<span class="math">\(\sim 1\)</span> hr),
<span class="math">\(K^*\)</span> may need to be limited before being passed to the atmosphere
via the coupler. Otherwise, the fluxes that are returned to CICE may
result in oscillating, highly inaccurate temperatures. The effect of
limiting is to treat the ice as a poor heat conductor. As a result,
winter growth rates are reduced, and the ice is likely to be too thin
(other things being equal). The values of <cite>hs_min</cite> and <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>
must therefore be chosen with care. If <cite>hs_min</cite> is too small, frequent
limiting is required, but if <cite>hs_min</cite> is too large, snow will be ignored
when its thermodynamic effects are significant. Likewise, infrequent
coupling requires more limiting, whereas frequent coupling is
computationally expensive.</p>
<p>This completes the specification of the matrix equations for the four
cases. We compute the new temperatures using a tridiagonal solver. After
each iteration we check to see whether the following conditions hold:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><span class="math">\(T_{sf} \leq 0^{circ}C\)</span>.</li>
<li>The change in <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> since the previous iteration is
less than a prescribed limit, <span class="math">\(\Delta T_{\max}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(F_0 \geq F_{ct}\)</span>. (If <span class="math">\(F_0 &lt; F_{ct}\)</span>, ice would be
growing at the top surface, which is not allowed.)</li>
<li>The rate at which energy is added to the ice by the external fluxes
equals the rate at which the internal ice energy is changing, to
within a prescribed limit <span class="math">\(\Delta F_{\max}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also check the convergence rate of <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>
is oscillating and failing to converge, we average temperatures from
successive iterations to improve convergence. When all these conditions
are satisfied—usually within two to four iterations for
<span class="math">\(\Delta T_{\max} \approx 0.01^{circ}C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Delta F_{max}
\approx 0.01 \ \mathrm{W/m^2}\)</span>—the calculation is complete.</p>
<p>To compute growth and melt rates (Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#thermo-growth"><span class="std std-ref">Growth and melting</span></a>,
we derive expressions for the enthalpy <span class="math">\(q\)</span>. The enthalpy of snow
(or fresh ice) is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[q_s(T) = - \rho_s (-c_0 T + L_0).\]</div>
<p>Sea ice enthalpy is more complex, because of brine pockets whose
salinity varies inversely with temperature. Since the salinity is
prescribed, there is a one-to-one relationship between temperature and
enthalpy. The specific heat of sea ice, given by
Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity">(114)</a>, includes not only the energy needed to warm or
cool ice, but also the energy used to freeze or melt ice adjacent to
brine pockets. Equation&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity">(114)</a> can be integrated to
give the energy <span class="math">\(\delta_e\)</span> required to raise the temperature of

<p>Multiplying by <span class="math">\(\rho_i\)</span> to change the units from
<span class="math">\(\mathrm {J/kg}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathrm {J/m^{3}}\)</span> and adding a term
for the energy needed to raise the meltwater temperature to , we
obtain the sea ice enthalpy:</p>

of microscopic brine inclusions surrounded by a matrix of pure water
ice. Both enthalpy and salinity are prognostic variables. The size of
the brine inclusions is assumed to be much smaller than the size of
the ice layers, allowing a continuum approximation: a bulk sea-ice

<p><em>Two stage outer iteration.</em></p>
<p>As for the BL99 thermodynamics
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#bl99" id="id178">[7]</a> there are two qualitatively different
situations that must be considered when solving for the vertical
thermodynamics: the surface can be melting and at the melting
temperature, or the surface can be colder than the melting temperature
and not melting. In the BL99 thermodynamics these two situations were
treated within the same iterative loop, but here they are dealt with
separately. If at the beginning of the time step the ice surface is cold
and not melting, we solve the ice temperatures assuming that this is
also true at the end of the time step. Once we have solved for the new
temperatures we test to see if the answer is consistent with this
assumption. If the surface temperature is below the melting temperature
then we have found the appropriate consistent solution. If the surface
is above the melting temperature at the end of the initial solution
attempt, we recalculate the new temperatures assuming the surface
temperature is fixed at the melting temperature. Alternatively if the
surface is at the melting temperature at the start of a time step, we
assume initially that this is also the case at the end of the time step,
solve for the new temperatures and then check that the surface
conductive heat flux is less than the surface atmospheric heat flux as
is required for a melting surface. If this is not the case, the
temperatures are recalculated assuming the surface is colder than
melting. We have found that solutions of the temperature equations that
only treat one of the two qualitatively different solutions at a time
are more numerically robust than if both are solved together. The
surface state rarely changes qualitatively during the solution so the
method is also numerically efficient.</p>
<p><em>Temperature updates.</em></p>
<p>During the calculation of the new temperatures
and salinities, the liquid fraction is held fixed at the value from the
previous time step. Updating the liquid fraction during the Picard
iteration described below was found to be numerically unstable. Keeping
the liquid fraction fixed drastically improves the numerical stability
of the method without significantly changing the solution.</p>
<p>Temperatures are calculated in a similar way to BL99 with an outer
Picard iteration of an inner tridiagonal matrix solve. The conservation
equation for the internal ice temperatures is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial{q}}{\partial{t}}=\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{z}} \left( K \frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}} \right) + w \frac{\partial{q_{br}}}{\partial{z}} + F\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is the sea ice enthalpy, <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is the bulk thermal
conductivity of the ice, <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is the vertical Darcy velocity of the
brine, <span class="math">\(q_{br}\)</span> is the brine enthalpy and <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is the
internally absorbed shortwave radiation. The first term on the right
represents heat conduction and the second term represents the vertical
advection of heat by gravity drainage and flushing.</p>
<p>The conductivity of the mush is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[K = \phi K_{br} + (1-\phi) K_{i}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(K_i = 2.3\)</span>&nbsp;Wm:math:<cite>^{-1}</cite>K<span class="math">\(^{-1}\)</span> is the
conductivity of pure ice and
<span class="math">\(K_{br}=0.5375\)</span>&nbsp;Wm:math:<cite>^{-1}</cite>K<span class="math">\(^{-1}\)</span> is the
conductivity of the brine. The thermal conductivity of brine is a
function of temperature and salinity, but here we take it as a constant
value for the middle of the temperature range experienced by sea ice,
<span class="math">\(-10^\circ\)</span>C <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#sp86" id="id179">[61]</a>, assuming the brine
liquidus salinity at <span class="math">\(-10^\circ\)</span>C.</p>
<p>We discretize the terms that include temperature in the heat
conservation equation as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-mushyheat">
<span class="eqno">(125)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-mushyheat" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\frac{q^{t}_k - q^{t_0}_k}{\Delta t} = \frac{\frac{K^*_{k+1}}{\Delta z^\prime_{k+1}} (T^t_{k+1} - T^t_k) - \frac{K^*_k}{\Delta z^\prime_k} (T^t_k - T^t_{k-1})}{\Delta h}\]</div>
<p>where the superscript signifies whether the quantity is evaluated at
the start (<span class="math">\(t_0\)</span>) or the end (<span class="math">\(t\)</span>) of the time step and the
subscript indicates the vertical layer. Writing out the temperature
dependence of the enthalpy term we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\left(\phi (c_w \rho_w - c_i \rho_i) + c_i \rho_i\right) T^t_k - (1-\phi) \rho_i L - q^{t_0}_k}{\Delta t} = \frac{ \frac{K^*_{k+1}}{\Delta z^\prime_{k+1}} (T^t_{k+1} - T^t_k) - \frac{K^*_k}{\Delta z^\prime_k} (T^t_k - T^t_{k-1})}{\Delta h}.\]</div>
<p>The mush thermal conductivities are fixed at the start of the timestep.
For the lowest ice layer <span class="math">\(T_{k+1}\)</span> is replaced with
<span class="math">\(T_{bot}\)</span>, the temperature of the ice base. <span class="math">\(\Delta h\)</span> is
the layer thickness and <span class="math">\(z^\prime_k\)</span> is the distance between the
<span class="math">\(k-1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> layer centers.</p>
<p>Similarly, for the snow layer temperatures we have the following
discretized equation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{c_i \rho_s T^t_k - \rho_s L_0- q^{t_0}_k}{\Delta t} = \frac{ \frac{K^*_{k+1}}{\Delta z^\prime_{k+1}} (T^t_{k+1} - T^t_k) - \frac{K^*_k}{\Delta z^\prime_k} (T^t_k - T^t_{k-1})}{\Delta h}.\]</div>
<p>For the upper-most layer (either ice layer or snow layer if it present)
<span class="math">\(T_{k-1}\)</span> is replaced with <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>, the temperature of the
surface.</p>
<p>If the surface is colder than the melting temperature then we also have
to solve for the surface temperature, <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>. Here we follow the
methodology of BL99 described above.</p>
<p>These discretized temperature equations form a tridiagional matrix for
the new temperatures and are solved with a standard tridiagonal solver.
A Picard iteration is used to incorporate nonlinearity in the equations.
The surface heat flux is a function of surface temperature and with each
iteration, the surface heat flux is calculated with the new surface
temperature until convergence is achieved. Convergence normally occurs
after a few iterations once the temperature changes during an iteration
fall below <span class="math">\(5\times10^{-4}\;^\circ\mathrm{C}\)</span> and the energy
conservation error falls below 0.9ferrmax.</p>
<p><em>Salinity updates.</em></p>
<p>Several physical processes alter the sea ice bulk
salinity. New ice forms with the salinity of the sea water from which it
formed. Gravity drainage reduces the bulk salinity of newly formed sea
ice, while flushing of melt water through the ice also alters the
salinity profile.</p>
<p>The salinity equation takes the form</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial{S}}{\partial{t}} = w \frac{\partial{S_{br}}}{\partial{z}} + G\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is a vertical Darcy velocity and <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a source
term. The right-hand side depends indirectly on the bulk salinity
through the liquid fraction (<span class="math">\(S = \phi S_{br}\)</span>). Since
<span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is fixed for the time step, we solve the salinity equation
explicitly after the temperature equation is solved.</p>
<p>A. Gravity drainage. Sea ice initially retains all the salt present in
the sea water from which it formed. Cold temperatures near the top
surface of forming sea ice result in higher brine salinities there,
because the brine is always at its melting temperature. This colder,
saltier brine is denser than the underlying sea water and the brine
undergoes convective overturning with the ocean. As the dense, cold
brine drains out of the ice, it is replaced by fresher seawater,
lowering the bulk salinity of the ice. Following
<a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#thb13" id="id180">[73]</a>, gravity drainage is assumed to occur as two
simultaneously operating modes: a rapid mode operating principally near

<p><em>Rapid drainage</em> takes the form of a vertically varying upward Darcy

the local Rayleigh number at a particular level,</p>
<div class="math">
\[Ra(z) = \frac{g \Delta \rho \Pi (h-z)}{\kappa \eta}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\Delta \rho\)</span> is the difference in density between the

<p>The unmodified flow rate, <span class="math">\(w\)</span>, is determined from a hydraulic

<p>There are three tunable parameters in the above parameterization,
<span class="math">\(a\)</span>, the diameter of the channel, <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span>, the horizontal
size of the mush draining through each channel, and <span class="math">\(Ra_c\)</span>, the

that <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> is proportional to <span class="math">\(l\)</span> so that

namelist parameters with default values of <span class="math">\(0.5\;\mathrm{mm}\)</span>, 1
and 10, respectively. The value <span class="math">\(\beta=1\)</span> gives a square aspect
ratio for the convective flow in the mush.</p>
<p>The <em>slow drainage</em> mode takes the form of a simple relaxation of bulk
salinity:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\left.\frac{\partial{S(z)}}{\partial{t}}\right|_{slow} = -\lambda (S(z) - S_c).\]</div>
<p>The decay constant, <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, is modeled as</p>

<span class="math">\(T_{bot}\)</span> is the basal ice temperature, <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> is the

<div class="math">
\[S_c(z) = \phi_c S_{br}(z)\]</div>

<p>B. Downwards flushing. Melt pond water drains through sea ice and
flushes out brine, reducing the bulk salinity of the sea ice. This is
modeled with the mushy physics option as a vertical Darcy flow through
the ice that affects both the enthalpy and bulk salinity of the sea ice:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\left.\frac{\partial{q}}{\partial{t}}\right|_{flush} = w_f \frac{\partial{q_{br}}}{\partial{z}}\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\left.\frac{\partial{S}}{\partial{t}} \right|_{flush}= w_f \frac{\partial{S_{br}}}{\partial{z}}\]</div>
<p>These equations are discretized with an upwind advection scheme. The
flushing Darcy flow, <span class="math">\(w_f\)</span>, is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[w_f=\frac{\overline{\Pi} \rho_w g \Delta h}{h \eta},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\overline{\Pi}\)</span> is the harmonic mean of the ice layer
permeabilities and <span class="math">\(\Delta h\)</span> is the hydraulic head driving melt
water through the sea ice. It is the difference in height between the
top of the melt pond and sea level.</p>
<p><em>Basal boundary condition.</em></p>
<p>In traditional Stefan problems the ice
growth rate is calculated by determining the difference in heat flux on
either side of the ice/ocean interface and equating this energy
difference to the latent heat of new ice formed. Thus,</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-growth-stefan">
<span class="eqno">(127)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-growth-stefan" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[(1-\phi_i) L_0 \rho_i \frac{\partial{h}}{\partial{t}} = K \left. \frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}} \right|_i - K_w \left. \frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}} \right|_w\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\((1-\phi_i)\)</span> is the solid fraction of new ice formed and
the right hand is the difference in heat flux at the ice–ocean interface
between the ice side and the ocean side of the interface. However, with
mushy layers there is usually no discontinuity in solid fraction across
the interface, so <span class="math">\(\phi_i=1\)</span> and Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-growth-stefan">(127)</a>
cannot be used explicitly. To circumvent this problem we set the
interface solid fraction to be 0.15, a value that reproduces
observations. <span class="math">\(\phi_i\)</span> is a namelist parameter (<cite>phi_i_mushy</cite> =
0.85). The basal ice temperature is set to the liquidus temperature
<span class="math">\(T_f\)</span> of the ocean surface salinity.</p>
<p><em>Tracer consistency.</em></p>
<p>In order to ensure conservation of energy and salt
content, the advection routines will occasionally limit changes to
either enthalpy or bulk salinity. The mushy thermodynamics routine
determines temperature from both enthalpy and bulk salinity. Since the
limiting changes performed in the advection routine are not applied
consistently (from a mushy physics point of view) to both enthalpy and
bulk salinity, the resulting temperature may be changed to be greater
than the limit allowed in the thermodynamics routines. If this situation
is detected, the code corrects the enthalpy so the temperature is below
the limiting value. Conservation of energy is ensured by placing the
excess energy in the ocean, and the code writes a warning that this has
occurred to the diagnostics file. This situation only occurs with the
mushy thermodynamics, and it should only occur very infrequently and
have a minimal effect on results. The addition of the heat to the ocean
may reduce ice formation by a small amount afterwards.</p>

         \end{array}
         \right.\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is the enthalpy of the surface ice or snow layer <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id184" id="id181">[1]</a>
(recall that <span class="math">\(q &lt; 0\)</span>) and <span class="math">\(\delta h\)</span> is the change in
thickness. If the layer melts completely, the remaining flux is used to
melt the layers beneath. Any energy left over when the ice and snow are
gone is added to the ocean mixed layer. Ice cannot grow at the top
surface due to conductive fluxes; however, snow–ice can form. New
snowfall is added at the end of the thermodynamic time step.</p>
<p>Growth and melting at the bottom ice surface are governed by</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-bottom-melting">
<span class="eqno">(129)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-bottom-melting" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[q \, \delta h = (F_{cb} - F_{bot}) \,

<p>where <span class="math">\(F_{bot}\)</span> is given by Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-fbot">(110)</a> and <span class="math">\(F_{cb}\)</span> is the
conductive heat flux at the bottom surface:</p>
<div class="math">
\[F_{cb} =   \frac{K_{i,N+1}}{\Delta h_i}  (T_{iN} - T_f).\]</div>
<p>If ice is melting at the bottom surface, <span class="math">\(q\)</span>
in&nbsp;Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-bottom-melting">(129)</a> is the enthalpy of the bottom ice layer. If
ice is growing, <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is the enthalpy of new ice with temperature
<span class="math">\(T_f\)</span> and salinity <span class="math">\(S_{max}\)</span> (<cite>ktherm</cite> = 1) or ocean surface
salinity (<cite>ktherm</cite> = 2). This ice is added to the bottom layer.</p>
<p>In general, frazil ice formed in the ocean is added to the thinnest ice
category. The new ice is grown in the open water area of the grid cell
to a specified minimum thickness; if the open water area is nearly zero
or if there is more new ice than will fit into the thinnest ice
category, then the new ice is spread over the entire cell.</p>
<p>If the latent heat flux is negative (i.e., latent heat is transferred
from the ice to the atmosphere), snow or snow-free ice sublimates at the
top surface. If the latent heat flux is positive, vapor from the
atmosphere is deposited at the surface as snow or ice. The thickness
change of the surface layer is given by</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-latent-heat">
<span class="eqno">(130)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-latent-heat" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[(\rho L_v - q) \delta h = F_l \Delta t,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> is the density of the surface material (snow or
ice), and <span class="math">\(L_v = 2.501 \times 10^6 \ \mathrm{J/kg}\)</span> is the latent
heat of vaporization of liquid water at . Note that <span class="math">\(\rho L_v\)</span> is
nearly an order of magnitude larger than typical values of <span class="math">\(q\)</span>.
For positive latent heat fluxes, the deposited snow or ice is assumed to
have the same enthalpy as the existing surface layer.</p>
<p>After growth and melting, the various ice layers no longer have equal
thicknesses. We therefore adjust the layer interfaces, conserving
energy, so as to restore layers of equal thickness
<span class="math">\(\Delta h_i = h_i / N_i\)</span>. This is done by computing the overlap
<span class="math">\(\eta_{km}\)</span> of each new layer <span class="math">\(k\)</span> with each old layer
<span class="math">\(m\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\eta_{km} = \min(z_m,z_k) - \max(z_{m-1},z_{k-1}),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(z_m\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z_k\)</span> are the vertical coordinates of the
old and new layers, respectively. The enthalpies of the new layers are</p>
<div class="math">
\[q_k = \frac{1}{\Delta h_i} \sum_{m=1}^{N_i} \eta_{km} q_m.\]</div>
<p>Lateral melting is accomplished by multiplying the state variables by
<span class="math">\(1-r_{side}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(r_{side}\)</span> is the fraction of ice melted
laterally <a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#mp87" id="id182">[49]</a><a class="reference internal" href="zreferences.html#steele92" id="id183">[64]</a>, and adjusting the ice
energy and fluxes as appropriate. We assume a floe diameter of 300&nbsp;m.</p>
<p><em>Snow ice formation.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the time step we check whether the
snow is deep enough to lie partially below the surface of the ocean
(freeboard). From Archimedes’ principle, the base of the snow is at sea
level when</p>
<div class="math">
\[\rho_i h_i + \rho_s h_s = \rho_w h_i.\]</div>
<p>Thus the snow base lies below sea level when</p>
<div class="math">
\[h^* \equiv h_s - \frac {(\rho_w-\rho_i) h_i}{\rho_s} &gt; 0.\]</div>
<p>In this case, for <cite>ktherm</cite> = 1 (BL99) we raise the snow base to sea level
by converting some snow to ice:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\begin{aligned}
\delta h_s &amp; = &amp; \frac{-\rho_i h^*}{\rho_w},  \\
\delta h_i &amp; = &amp; \frac{\rho_s h^*}{\rho_w}.\end{aligned}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In rare cases this process can increase the ice thickness
substantially. For this reason snow–ice conversions are postponed until
after the remapping in thickness space
(Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#itd-trans"><span class="std std-ref">Transport in thickness space</span></a>), which assumes that ice growth during
a single time step is fairly small.</p>
<p>For <cite>ktherm</cite> = 2 (mushy), we model the snow–ice formation process as
follows: If the ice surface is below sea level then we replace some snow
with the same thickness of sea ice. The thickness change chosen is that
which brings the ice surface to sea level. The new ice has a porosity of
the snow, which is calculated as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\phi = 1 - \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_i}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\rho_s\)</span> is the density of snow and <span class="math">\(\rho_i\)</span> is the
density of fresh ice. The salinity of the brine occupying the above
porosity within the new ice is taken as the sea surface salinity. Once
the new ice is formed, the vertical ice and snow layers are regridded
into equal thicknesses while conserving energy and salt.</p>
