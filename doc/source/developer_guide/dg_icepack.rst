Icepack
==================

The CICE model calls the Icepack columnphysics source code.  The Icepack model is documented
separately, see https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack.

More specifically, the CICE model uses methods defined in **icepack_intfc.F90**.  It uses 
the init, query, and write methods to set, get, and document Icepack values.  And it follows
the icepack_warnings methodology where **icepack_warnings_aborted** is checked and
**icepack_warnings_flush** is called after every call to an Icepack method.  
It does not directly "use" Icepack data, accessing Icepack data only thru interfaces.
