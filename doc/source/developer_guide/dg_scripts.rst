Scripts 
========

The scripts are the third part of the cice package.  They support setting up
cases, building, and running the cice stand-alone model.

File List

.. _dev_strategy:

Strategy
-----------

The cice scripts are implemented such that everything is resolved after
**cice.setup** is called.  This is done by both copying specific files
into the case directory and running scripts as part of the **cice.setup**
command line to setup various files.

**cice.setup** drives the case setup.  It is written in csh.  All supporting
scripts are relatively simple csh or sh scripts.  See :ref:`scripts` for additional
details.

The file **cice.settings** specifies a set of env defaults for the case.  The file
**ice_in** defines the namelist input for the cice driver.


.. _dev_preset_options:

Preset Case Options
---------------------

The ``cice.setup --set`` option allows the user to choose some predetermined cice
settings and namelist.  Those options are defined in **configurations/scripts/options/**
and the files are prefixed by either set_env or set_nml.  When **cice.setup**
is executed, the appropriate files are read from **configurations/scripts/options/**
and the **cice.settings** and/or **ice_in** files are updated in the case directory
based on the values in those files.

The filename suffix determines the name of the -s option.  So, for instance, 

  ``cice.setup -s diag1,debug,bgcISPOL``

will search for option files with suffixes of diag1, debug, and bgcISPOL and then
apply those settings.  

**parse_namelist.sh**, **parse_settings.sh**, and **parse_namelist_from_settings.sh** 
are the three scripts that modify **ice_in** and **cice.settings**.

To add new options, just add new files to the **configurations/scripts/options/** directory
with appropriate names and syntax.  The set_nml file syntax is the same as namelist
syntax and the set_env files are consistent with csh setenv syntax.  See other files for
examples of the syntax.  The name of the option (i.e. diag1, debug, bgcISPOL) should not
have any special characters in the name as this can impact scripts usage.

.. _build:

Build Scripts
--------------

CICE uses GNU Make to build the model.  There is a common **Makefile** for all machines.  
Each machine provides a Macros file to define some Makefile variables
and and an env file to specify the modules/software stack for each compiler.
The machine is built by the cice.build script which invokes Make.
There is a special trap for circular dependencies in the cice.build script to
highlight this error when it occurs.

The **cice.build** script has some additional features including the ability to 
pass a Makefile target.  This is documented in :ref:`cicebuild`.  In addition, there
is a hidden feature in the **cice.build** script that allows for reuse of 
executables.  This is used by the test suites to significantly reduce cost of
building the model.  It is invoked with the ``--exe`` argument to **cice.build**
and should not be invoked by users interactively.

.. _dev_machines:

Machines
-----------

Machine specific information is contained in **configuration/scripts/machines**.  That
directory contains a Macros file and an env file for each supported machine.
One other files will need to be
changed to support a port, that is **configuration/scripts/cice.batch.csh**.
To port to a new machine, see :ref:`porting`.  

.. _dev_test_options:

Test Options
---------------

Values that are associated with the `--sets` cice.setup are defined in 
**configuration/scripts/options**.  Those files are text files and cice.setup
uses the values in those files to modify the `cice.settings` and `ice_in` files
in the case as the case is created.  Files name `set_env.$option` are associated
with values in the `cice.settings` file.  Files named `set_nml.$option` are associated
with values in `ice.in`.  These files contain simple keyword pair values one line
at a time.  A line starting with # is a comment.  Files names that start with `test_`
are used specifically for tests.

That directory also contains files named `set_files.$option`.  This provides an
extra layer on top of the individual setting files that allows settings to be
defined based on groups of other settings.  The `set_files.$option` files
contain a list of `--sets` options to be applied.  

The $option part of the filename is the argument to `--sets` argument in `cice.setup`.
Multiple options can be specified by creating a comma delimited list.  In the case
where settings contradict each other, the last defined is used.

.. _dev_testing:

Test scripts
-------------

Under **configuration/scripts/tests** are several files including the scripts to 
setup the various tests, such as smoke and restart tests (**test_smoke.script**, **test_restart.script**)
and the files that describe with options files are needed for each test (ie. **test_smoke.files**, **test_restart.files**).
A baseline test script (**baseline.script**) is also there to setup the general regression
and comparison testing.  That directory also contains the preset test suites 
(ie. **base_suite.ts**) and a script (**report_results.csh**) that pushes results from 
test suites back to the CICE-Consortium test results wiki page.

To add a new test (for example newtest), several files may be needed,

- **configuration/scripts/tests/test_newtest.script** defines how to run the test.  This chunk
  of script will be incorporated into the case test script
- **configuration/scripts/tests/test_newtest.files** list the set of options files found in
  **configuration/scripts/options/** needed to
  run this test.  Those files will be copied into the test directory when the test is invoked
  so they are available for the **test_newtest.script** to use.
- some new files may be needed in **configuration/scripts/options/**.  These could be relatively
  generic **set_nml** or **set_env** files, or they could be test specific files typically carrying
  a prefix of **test_nml**.

Generating a new test, particularly the **test_newtest.script** usually takes some iteration before
it's working properly.

.. _dev_validation:

QC Process Validation
----------------------

The code validation (aka QC or quality control) test validates non bit-for-bit model changes.  The directory 
**configuration/scripts/tests/QC** contains scripts related to the validation testing,
and this process is described in :ref:`validation`.  This section will describe a set
of scripts that test and validate the QC process.  This should be done 
when the QC test or QC test scripts (i.e., ``cice.t-test.py``) are modified.  
Again, this section **documents a validation process for the QC scripts**; it does not
describe to how run the validation test itself.  

Two scripts have been created to automatically validate the QC script.  
These scripts are:

* ``gen_qc_cases.csh``, which creates the 4 test cases required for validation,
  builds the executable, and submits to the queue.
* ``compare_qc_cases.csh``, which runs the QC script on three combinations
  of the 4 test cases and outputs whether or not the correct response was received.

The ``gen_qc_cases.csh`` script allows users to pass some arguments similar
to the ``cice.setup`` script.  These options include:

* ``--mach, -m``: Machine (REQUIRED)
* ``--env,  -e``: Compiler
* ``--pes,  -p``: tasks x threads
* ``--acct``    : Account number for batch submission
* ``--grid, -g``: Grid
* ``--queue``   : Queue for the batch submission
* ``--testid``  : test ID, user-defined id for testing

The script creates 4 test cases, with testIDs ``qc_base``, ``qc_bfb``, ``qc_test``,
and ``qc_fail``.  ``qc_base`` is the base test case with the default QC namelist.
``qc_bfb`` is identical to ``qc_base``.  ``qc_test`` is a test that is not bit-for-bit
when compared to ``qc_base``, but not climate changing.  ``qc_fail`` is a test that is not
bit-for-bit and also climate changing.

In order to run the ``compare_qc_cases.csh`` script, the following requirements must be met:

* Python v2.7 or later
* netcdf Python package
* numpy Python package

To install the necessary Python packages, the ``pip`` Python utility can be used.

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --user netCDF4
  pip install --user numpy

**Note:** Some machines might report ``pip: Command not found.``  If you encounter this error,
check to see if there is any Python module (``module avail python``) that you might need
to load prior to using ``pip``.

To perform the QC validation, execute the following commands.

.. code-block:: bash

  # From the CICE base directory
  cp configuration/scripts/tests/QC/gen_qc_cases.csh .
  cp configuration/scripts/tests/QC/compare_qc_cases.csh .
  
  # Create the required test cases
  ./gen_qc_cases.csh -m <machine> --acct <acct>

  # Wait for all 4 jobs to complete

  # Perform the comparisons
  ./compare_qc_cases.csh

The ``compare_qc_cases.csh`` script will run the QC script on the following combinations:

* ``qc_base`` vs. ``qc_bfb``
* ``qc_base`` vs. ``qc_nonbfb``
* ``qc_base`` vs. ``qc_fail``

An example of the output from ``compare_qc_cases.csh`` is shown below.::
