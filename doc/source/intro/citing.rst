Citing the CICE code
====================

If you use the CICE code, please cite the version you are using with the CICE 
Digital Object Identifier (DOI):

DOI:10.5281/zenodo.1205674 (https://zenodo.org/record/1205674) 

This DOI can be used to cite all CICE versions and the URL will default to the most recent version. 
However, each released version of CICE will also receive its own, unique DOI that can be 
used for citations as well.

Please also make the CICE-Consortium aware of any publications and model use.
