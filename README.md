Distribution Policy

Purpose:
This policy is intended to protect individual authorship and intellectual property rights for both Consortium Members and the broader CICE user community, while encouraging open, collaborative software development.

Authority:
This policy is issued under the authority of the CICE Consortium Executive Oversight Board.

Applicability:
Access to all software by any person or group will be conducted under this distribution policy.  The following procedures apply to anyone within a research group using a private branch or fork of the repository.

Procedure Description:
The CICE Consortium strives to maintain an open software development environment for its membership and in support of the larger sea ice modeling community.   In particular, public branches/repositories that contain the latest released and beta versions of the software are readable by everyone.  New developments underway at individual institutions may be kept on private branches or forks of the repository, and will be merged into the public branches once the software is sufficiently vetted.  Developers may choose to keep new software developments on their private branch or fork until it has been documented in a peer reviewed publication and can be referenced.
 
Much of the Consortium’s work will be done using the public branches.  However, as new software capabilities and other software modifications are incorporated into the CICE model by developers, assistance from several Consortium Members may be needed to address issues that span multiple Teams, requiring that these private branches be shared beyond the individual institution doing the primary development.  
 
Individuals doing research resulting in presentations, papers or published simulation output agree to the following procedures:
Users of publicly available software are requested to acknowledge the CICE Consortium in all publications utilizing CICE or its associated tools, as follows:

“The CICE Consortium is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Department of Defense, Department of Commerce, National Science Foundation, and Environment and Climate Change Canada.”

For new software that resides on a private branch or fork of the repository but is not publicly available (i.e. not yet on the beta branch), an offer of coauthorship must be made to software contributors by anyone producing publishable results specifically utilizing that software, and include in all related products acknowledgment of the CICE Consortium and specific funding sources as requested by the software contributors.  

To avoid violating this policy for software on private branches/forks, users shall notify the Team Leads of the relevant team(s) before beginning any work with nonpublic and unreferenced software that might result in a product such as a publication, presentation or simulation output, to identify and coordinate with the relevant software contributors.

Researchers who use software on private branches or forks shall not redistribute that software to anyone outside of a research group.  Anyone with access to the software or simulations will take reasonable precautions to ensure the software or simulations are not accessed by unauthorized persons.
 
Complaints of possible misconduct under this policy shall be brought to the Lead Coordinator and will be referred to the Executive Oversight Board for investigation and potential corrective actions.

Definitions:

“Software” refers to the CICE sea ice model algorithms, source code, and object code, and its associated scripts, tools, data bases and related documentation.
 
“Released software” has been fully vetted and resides on the release (master) branch of the repository, openly accessible to the public.  
 
“Beta software” has been partially vetted and resides on the beta (development) branch of the repository, openly accessible to the public.  It includes newer software contributions that have been tested on private branches/forks and are undergoing more rigorous testing prior to full release on the master branch.
 
“Consortium Members” are the institutions or projects represented on the Executive Oversight Board, making substantial in-kind contributions toward achieving the Consortium’s goals and purposes.
 
“Developers” are individuals or groups that produce new software or software modifications for CICE.
 
“Intellectual property” means any and all trade marks, designs, patents, copyright, confidential information, trade or business names, database rights, know-how, technology and other intellectual property rights (and any applications for the foregoing) whether registerable or not in any country.

Review and Amendment:
This document will be reviewed two years from its effective date, and renewed or replaced to ensure that the distribution policy of the Consortium remains relevant and supports its goals and purposes.  Amendments to this document may be made with the approval of the Executive Oversight Board and the Sponsors.
